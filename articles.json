Is it a sign that Bitcoin and altcoins will rise higher? \nThe stablecoin market capitalization reached a record high following a period of consistent growth since mid-2023, according to data from Alphractal.\u00a0\nThe data analysis platform\u00a0reported\u00a0on Jan. 31 that the stablecoin market cap rose 73% from $121.18 billion in August 2023 to reach an all-time high of $211 billion, while USDC (USDC)\u00a0 has been gaining an edge over other stablecoins.\nStablecoin market capitalization.

Source: CoinMarketCap\nThis increase aligns with a rise in demand, with USDC pairs recording an all-time high daily trading volume of $20 billion on Jan. 18. As a result, USDC\u2019s market share by market capitalization has risen significantly to 24.6% on Jan. 31.\u00a0\nAn earlier report by Cointelegraph showed a 78% year-over-year growth in USDC circulation, outpacing the growth rate of all global stablecoins. As of Jan. 31, USDC\u2019s circulating supply is at $53.4 billion, more than double the 2023 low of less than $24 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\u00a0\nAlphractal said that USDC has benefitted from the recent drop in altcoins, with investors converting a large portion of their crypto holdings into USDC.\nThe USDC market spike in 2024 followed a massive drop in 2023 when the stablecoin\u2019s market value shrank as much as 45% following Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s (SVB) failure.\nRelated: Bitwise\u2019s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF clears first SEC hurdle\nUSDC\u2019s dominance is around the same level it was at the end of the 2021 bull cycle.

Source: Alphractal\nDuring the last bull market cycle, USDC supply began rising in May and peaked in March 2022, approximately four months after asset prices peaked.\nThe total stablecoin market cap grew by 177% between April 2021, peaking at $167.5 billion in March 2022.\u00a0\nIf the current stablecoin market supply continues growing and crypto prices begin to decline, the market may reach its peak over the next few months.\u00a0\nOn the contrary, a rising stablecoin market cap is usually associated with growing investor conviction, signaling the potential for boosted capital inflows. This suggests that the bullish momentum could continue for a few more months.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": " Bitcoin accounts for nearly 15% of El Salvador\u2019s reserves as President Bukele doubles down on his bold crypto strategy, even after inking a deal with the IMF. \nIf El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele stood firm on his country\u2019s Bitcoin gambit during the darkest days of the last crypto winter, it\u2019s hard to imagine him backing off now\u2014with Bitcoin surging past $100,000 and a pro-crypto Trump administration on the White House.\nIn December 2024, the El Salvador made headlines when it announced a new IMF deal, injecting fresh momentum into its debt-laden economy and providing crucial financing for the future. The agreement also marked what appeared to be a truce with traditional financial markets, which had long viewed El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin gamble with skepticism.\nHowever, the deal\u2014still awaiting IMF board approval\u2014came at a personal cost for Bukele. El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, must now relinquish its mandatory acceptance policy and make Bitcoin usage voluntary for businesses. Additionally, the government must refrain from collecting taxes in Bitcoin, potentially signaling a retreat from Bukele\u2019s ambitious crypto agenda.\nYet Bukele remains undeterred. Shortly after the deal was announced, El Salvador doubled down, buying over two dozen Bitcoin in the first weeks of January. This accumulation strategy has yielded significant profits but also strained ties with the IMF. \nNow, with President Trump pushing for cryptocurrency expansion in the US and exploring a national digital asset reserve, Bukele is doubling down\u2014confident that Bitcoin\u2019s best days, and El Salvador\u2019s bet on it, are still ahead.\n\u201cThis year, with Trump\u2019s inauguration and the coming of age of Bitcoin ETFs, will be crucial for both Bitcoin and the broader ecosystem...and we\u2019re reaping the benefits,\u201d Bukele said at a press conference on Jan. 14. \nHe predicted \u201ca probably exponential\u201d surge in value with the Republican president now leading the world\u2019s largest economy, and with Bukele as one of the few, select guests to his inauguration ceremony\u2014an event he ultimately would not attend.\nIndeed, 2024 ended on a high note for Bukele. Once notorious for having one of the highest homicide rates in the world, El Salvador wrapped up the year as one of the safest countries in Latin America. Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2014boldly incorporated into the country\u2019s national reserves\u2014soared past $100,000 following the US election. To top it off, the IMF deal offered a pathway to ease El Salvador\u2019s debt burden.\nWhile some IMF conditions may constrain Bukele\u2019s ambitions, experts argue the trade-off is worthwhile. Compliance would allow for a $1.4 billion loan, providing much-needed financial relief and marking a return to the international financial fold after years of relative isolation.\nGovernment gross debt as a % of GDP. Source: IMF.\n\u201cThe IMF doesn\u2019t mind the government promoting Bitcoin use voluntarily, but it does take issue with it being declared legal tender,\u201d said Carlos Acevedo, a former Central Bank of El Salvador governor, in an interview with Cointelegraph. \nThrough a consistent accumulation policy, El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin holdings have now swelled to over 600 BTC (BTC). At current market rates, these holdings total nearly $600 million, making up almost 15% of the country\u2019s total international reserves. According to Bitbo, this places El Salvador sixth in the world for sovereign Bitcoin holdings.\n\u201cYou can call it our first Bitcoin piggy bank,\u201d Bukele said last year after transferring the country\u2019s crypto holdings to a cold wallet.\nEl Salvador's Bitcoin holdings. Source: El Salvador's Bitcoin Office\nReelected in 2024 after a landslide victory, Bukele\u2019s presidency has been marked by a controversial but widely supported crackdown on organized crime, which has led to mass detentions and drawn criticism from human rights groups. Despite this, his hardline approach has earned him widespread popularity among Salvadorans.\nBut Bukele\u2019s vision for the country extends beyond public safety. Leveraging his background as an advertising executive, he is on a mission to rebrand the small, resource-scarce nation as a global cryptocurrency haven to attract international investors and grow its economy.\nEl Salvador is gradually becoming a hotspot for crypto firms thanks to its crypto-friendly regulations. Recently, Tether, a dominant force in the stablecoin market, announced it would relocate to El Salvador after securing a license as a digital asset service provider. The co-founders of USDT, the world\u2019s biggest stablecoin, have even moved their residences to the country.\n\u201cThe profit from Bitcoin investment is just a number; it doesn\u2019t mean much compared to the brand value of the whole project,\u201d said Stacy Herbert, head of El Salvador\u2019s National Bitcoin Office, in an interview with Cointelegraph. \nHerbert added that other crypto companies are also in the process of securing licenses. According to Guilherme Rebane, a partner at digital asset trading firm Nonco, El Salvador\u2019s tailor-made regulations for Bitcoin and the broader crypto sector, combined with strong industry momentum, bode well for the industry in El Salvador.\n\u201cWe can expect greater interest from companies looking to explore opportunities here, and Tether\u2019s move has certainly drawn increased attention,\u201d he said.\nIndeed, having one foot in this Bitcoin-friendly nation is seemingly becoming a powerful marketing tool as well.\n\u201cMy impression is that Tether is coming to El Salvador as a way to expand its global reputation,\u201d said Elo\u00edsa Cardenas, Chief Innovation Officer at Monetae, an El Salvador-based exchange. \nRelated: Failure or 5D chess? El Salvador IMF deal walks back Bitcoin adoption\nDespite the global attention El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin strategy has garnered, local adoption has been less encouraging.\nA recent poll revealed that just 7.5% of Salvadorans have used Bitcoin so far. During a visit by a Cointelegraph reporter, some locals displayed a lack of understanding about using Bitcoin, and establishments advertising Bitcoin payments were unable to process transactions reportedly due to technical issues.\n92% of surveyed Salvadorans said they didn\u2019t use Bitcoin for transactions. Source: UFG\nWhile Bukele\u2019s security policies have propelled him to a landslide 85% victory in the 2024 presidential elections, not everyone is sold on his Bitcoin pursuit.\n\u201cI hardly know anyone who uses Bitcoin for everyday transactions,\u201d said Acevedo, the former central banker. \u201cEven for those who invest in Bitcoin, it requires a certain income level that most of the population does not have\u201480% earn minimum wage.\u201d\nSome residents argue that the nation\u2019s \u201cpiggy bank\u201d could be put to better use. \u201cThis Bitcoin investment would be better spent on schools, hospitals, and job opportunities,\u201d said Salvadoran citizen Cristian Castillo in an interview with regional media.\nDespite the concerns around El Salvador\u2019s strategy and the adoption hang ups, experts continue to back Bukele\u2019s strategy, which has so far produced significant returns.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the government\u2019s decision to keep accumulating Bitcoin at a steady pace is wrong; it will continue to grow in value,\u201d Acevedo said. \nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": " Bitcoin price moves closer to its all-time high, and the absence of euphoria in derivatives markets is a positive sign. \nBitcoin (BTC) is trading less than 5% below its all-time high of $109,500, yet demand for leverage in perpetual contracts remains balanced between longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers). At first, this might seem concerning, but it does not necessarily increase the likelihood of a correction below $100,000.\nBitcoin perpetual futures funding rate, 8-hour. Source: CoinGlass\nExchanges charge either longs or shorts to compensate for imbalances in leveraged demand. In a well-balanced market, the 8-hour funding rate hovers near zero, which has been the case for the past few weeks. Periods of heightened excitement can push this rate above 0.20%, equivalent to 1.8% per month.\nThe launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the growing adoption of BTC reserves by corporations have diminished the influence of retail investors. For context, the spot BTC ETFs collectively hold 6.7% of the total Bitcoin supply, while companies such as MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, Tether, Tesla, and Coinbase control an additional 4.3%.\nInstitutional demand for Bitcoin futures has surged, leading the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to capture 85% of the monthly futures market. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX continue to dominate perpetual contracts, the preferred instrument among retail traders. This shift highlights the declining influence of retail participation in Bitcoin price discovery.\nBitcoin futures monthly contracts open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.ch\nCME\u2019s $18.6 billion open interest in monthly BTC futures has become a critical benchmark, offering global hedge funds and investment banks a regulated gateway to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The instrument facilitates both long and short positions while ensuring liquidity and access to leverage.\nSimilarly, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 introduced a new class of investors, including pension funds, wealth managers, and retirement savings accounts. These instruments have surpassed $120 billion in assets under management (AUM), enhancing market liquidity, improving price discovery, and supporting the development of ETF options listed on the NYSE, CBOE, and Nasdaq.\nWhile spot Bitcoin ETFs are not directly tied to Bitcoin\u2019s price, the success of MicroStrategy\u2019s stock and debt offerings has created an alternative liquidity channel. This has lowered barriers for investors unable to hold spot Bitcoin ETFs, as seen in the recent $500 million investment by Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\nRather than focusing solely on futures demand, traders should analyze the Bitcoin options market to gauge professional sentiment on potential downturns. The 25% delta skew metric (put-call ratio) typically ranges between -6% and +6% in neutral markets, moving below this range in bullish conditions.\nBitcoin options 25% delta skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch\nBetween Jan. 21 and Jan. 27, whales and market makers displayed optimism regarding Bitcoin\u2019s price, but sentiment became more balanced after BTC retested the $98,000 support level. Currently, the -5% delta skew reflects a moderate level of optimism, indicating a favorable environment for potential Bitcoin price appreciation.\nHowever, excessive confidence can be a warning sign, as routine price corrections often lead to liquidations. Some of the hesitation among investors as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high stems from US President Trump\u2019s self-imposed Feb. 1 decision to implement 25% import tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China.\nRelated: Bitcoin's February momentum hinges on next week's labor market data\nAdditionally, concerns over slowing revenue growth among major global corporations, particularly Apple, have contributed to uncertainty. The rise of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI model has intensified doubts about US tech sector capital expenditures. As a result, Bitcoin investors are wary of a broader economic slowdown, which could favor cash positions and short-term government bonds.\nUltimately, the lack of excessive bullish sentiment in Bitcoin derivatives is not a sign of weakness but rather a reflection of broader market caution beyond the cryptocurrency sector.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witnessed $4.2 billion in inflows between Jan. 1 and Jan. 24, which is 6% of all ETF inflows, according to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg.\nWhile the institutions are buying, retail investors seem to be booking profits in Bitcoin.

Source: Coin360\nAfter Bitcoin\u2019s strong showing in January, the focus shifts to February. Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin\u2019s performance in February depends on the crucial labor market report due on Feb. 7. A weakening labor market data could \u201cstrengthen the case for rate cuts,\u201d which is likely to \u201ccreate a more supportive environment for Bitcoin.\u201d On the other hand, a strong labor market reduces the possibility of Fed rate cuts, resulting in a pullback in Bitcoin.\nCould Bitcoin overcome the $109,588 resistance and rise to a new all-time high? Will altcoins join Bitcoin higher? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.\nBitcoin is gradually climbing toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating sustained buying by the bulls.\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 20-day exponential moving average ($102,198) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, suggesting an advantage to the bulls. If buyers propel the price above $109,588, the BTC/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend to $118,109 and then to $126,706.\nThe 50-day simple moving average ($99,398) is the critical support to watch out on the downside. If this support gives way, the pair may dive to $90,000. Buyers are expected to mount a strong defense in the $90,000 to $85,000 zone.\u00a0\nEther (ETH) bulls pushed the price back above the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern on Jan. 30, signaling buying at lower levels.\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe momentum picked up on Jan. 31, and the bulls pushed the price above the downtrend line. There is minor resistance at the 50-day SMA ($3,413) but it is likely to be crossed. The ETH/USDT pair may rise to $3,525 and then to $3,745.\nTime is running out for the bears. If they want to regain control, they will have to tug the price below the $3,000 support. If they do that, the pair could tumble to the solid support at $2,850.\nXRP (XRP) held the 20-day EMA ($2.97) on Jan. 29, but the bulls are struggling to push the price to the downtrend line.\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe bears will try to yank and maintain the price below the breakout level of $2.91. If they can pull it off, the XRP/USDT pair could decline to the 50-day SMA ($2.60). Buyers are expected to defend this level because a break below the 50-day SMA could sink the pair to $2.20 and then to $2.\nThis negative view will be invalidated if the price rises and closes above the downtrend line. The pair could climb to $3.40, which is a strong obstacle.

If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $25.\nInstead, if the price rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could attempt a rally to the 50-day SMA, which will signal a consolidation between $30.59 and $45.05.\nStellar (XLM) bounced off the $0.39 support and rose above the moving averages on Jan. 30, indicating solid buying by the bulls.\nXLM/USDT daily chart.

For instance, analyst Ted Pillows suggests that ETH could easily hit $4,500 in February and establish new record highs by March as WLF buys up thousands of ETH. \nHe further cites Ether\u2019s bullish rejection during the DeepSeek-led global market rout, confirming strong demand in the accumulation area as shown below, which could have ETH\u2019s price pursue a \u201cshort-term expansion\u201d in the coming month.\nSource: Ted Pillows\nAdditionally, analyst Lark Davis points to Ethereum\u2019s strong historical performance in February in the past eight years. On average, ETH has gained over 17% during the month, recording nine positive returns and only one negative.\nSource: Lark Davis\nIf history repeats, ETH\u2019s price can rise toward the $4,000-4,500 target in February, especially with Trump\u2019s WLFI buying \u201ctruckloads of Ethereum\u201d and supporting the overall upside outlook.\nThe ETH/BTC pair has been bleeding since 2017.

        "content": " Bitcoin kicked off 2025 with a bang, but a fresh set of factors needs time to congeal before BTC price can chase new highs. \nBitcoin (BTC) had a strong start to 2025, gaining 13.5% in the first 30 days. This price movement reflected a complete turnaround in the United States government\u2019s attitude, becoming more favorable for the sector. However, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been capped at $105,000, leading traders to question the reasons behind the apparent stagnation.\nS&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: Tradingview / Cointelegraph\nThe conditions for a sustained Bitcoin bull run are present, but three factors are preventing a new all-time high. The Trump presidency in the US is increasing opportunities for banks and hedge funds to custody digital assets without affecting their balance sheets.\nUS Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, addressed the issue in a press conference after a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Jan. 29. Powell stated that banks were \u201cperfectly able to serve crypto customers,\u201d provided they managed the risks, adding that the institution is \u201cnot against innovation.\u201d\nOn Jan. 30, the board of the Czech National Bank approved a proposal to assess Bitcoin investments as part of its international reserve management strategy. The announcement followed CNB Governor Ale\u0161 Michl\u2019s interview with the Financial Times, in which he revealed the intention to allocate up to 5% of the country\u2019s \u20ac140 billion reserves to Bitcoin.\nBitcoin ETFs assets under management, USD. Source: CoinGlass\nFurther boosting Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum was the announcement on Jan. 30 from a fund managed by the Norwegian Central Bank, revealing investments of $500 million in MicroStrategy shares. It is important to note that some funds require shareholder approval or face regulatory restrictions to purchase Bitcoin using spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), hence the use of the US-listed company as a proxy.\nDespite favorable news flow, Bitcoin\u2019s price was unable to break above the $106,000 barrier. Therefore, analyzing what is causing investors to act more cautiously is essential to understanding the timeframe for a new BTC all-time high. Traders fear that the global economic slowdown will trigger a \u201cflight to quality\u201d movement, where the market seeks shelter in cash and short-term government bonds.\nThe US gross domestic product grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024, slightly below market expectations. Similarly, the eurozone economy posted zero growth during the period, according to data released on Jan. 30. The lack of growth will likely force central banks to inject stimulus measures, which is beneficial for Bitcoin\u2019s price in the medium term. However, traders fear that the short-term negative impact could harm Bitcoin\u2019s price.\nThe recent launch of a new low-cost AI chatbot by Chinese startup DeepSeek surprised the industry, causing record-breaking losses in stocks. Traders saw the sector\u2019s relative fragility for the first time. Even though there\u2019s no direct impact on BTC, investor risk appetite was reduced as hedge funds tend to decrease exposure in assets that have gained the most, and BTC outperformed most sectors.\nRelated: El Salvador rushes in new Bitcoin law to comply with IMF deal: Report\nThe Trump administration is definitely dismantling Operation Choke Point 2.0, but that does not mean banks will start embracing Bitcoin immediately. There needs to be clearer accounting and risk-calculation rules and perhaps the approval of in-kind ETFs, which would allow more integration with traditional markets.\nUntil these three conditions are met, Bitcoin\u2019s upside above $105,000 appears limited. However, further institutional adoption, especially from nation-states, could propel BTC\u2019s price much higher.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Data from Glassnode highlighted that BTC retail spend volumes of wallets holding less than 0.1 BTC had dropped by 48% since November 2024. \nBitcoin spent volume by Wallet size. Source: Glassnode\nThe spending volume peaked in November, with investors spending over $20.6 million per hour, compared to $10.7 million per hour on Jan. 30. \nMeanwhile, Quinten Francois, a crypto commentator, also mentioned that despite Bitcoin trading above $100,000, the retail interest has reached a three-year low. \nRelated: BTC price taps $106K as US GDP miss boosts Bitcoin bull case\nOne particular reason why retail investment in Bitcoin has dropped when compared to previous market cycles is the concept of \u201cunit bias.\u201d \nUnit bias is a psychological heuristic in behavioral economics that suggests that individuals usually like to own a complete unit or stock regardless of its price and size. With Bitcoin, most investors currently view $100,000 as \u201ctoo expensive.\u201d  \nSunny Po, an anonymous Bitcoin proponent, aptly explained the mindset of a new investor and said, \nIn 2024, XRP gained attention because of its low price, leading to clickbait posts with unrealistic predictions like \u201c$XRP to $1,000\u201d or \u201c$XRP to $10,000.\u201d Many overlook market cap realities, but these bold claims attract new investors, especially when compared to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 has been largely led by institutions and the rise of spot BTC ETFs. While retail interest has dropped since November, data from CoinGlass indicated that the total market cap of BTC ETFs increased from $70 billion on Nov. 5 to $125 billion on Jan. 30, i.e., a 78% rise. \nBitcoin ETF market cap data. Source: CoinGlass\nA fair assumption is that new investors are possibly favoring exposure through the BTC ETFs as well since self-custody is not required in such third-party investment vehicles. Therefore, while retail investors may be active, they are not generating new blockchain addresses, which are typically classified as retail onchain activity.\nAccording to Glassnode, investors moved most Bitcoin from exchanges to ETF custodian wallets, reducing balances from 3.1 million to 2.7 million in seven months, further validating the above argument. \nRelated: Forget FOMC \u2014 Bitcoin price now has 'plenty of room' to reach $108K\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Cointelegraph explores the nuts and bolts of the niche industry. \nOn Jan. 16, Coinbase re-launched a Bitcoin-backed loan service, allowing US users to borrow USDC (USDC) using their Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral.\u00a0\nCoinbase launches BTC-backed loans. Source: @coinbase on X\nCoinbase\u2019s loan service is a mix of CeFi and DeFi. The company converts BTC into wrapped BTC (cbBTC), which it then transfers to Morpho, a DeFi protocol built on Base. The latter then manages the loan terms and interest rates dynamically.\u00a0\nWhile the concept itself isn\u2019t novel \u2014 Bitcoin-backed loans have existed at least since 2017 \u2014 this move is noteworthy and possibly reflects growing market demand.\nInterest in Bitcoin and crypto-backed loans appears to be returning. In its August 2024 report\u00a0HTF Market Intelligence estimated the current size of the Bitcoin loan market at $8.6 billion and projected this figure to reach $45.6 billion by 2030.\nPutting one\u2019s Bitcoin to work can be a smart move, but it\u2019s not without risk (remember Celsius?). Some investors might view the entry of traditional finance institutions, with stronger customer protection procedures as a sign that Bitcoin-backed loans could be more secure going forward. Take, for example, Cantor Fitzgerald, a New York financial firm that has invested in Tether and launched a Bitcoin lending program in November 2024.\u00a0\nAfter the repeal of the infamous SAB 121 accounting rule on Jan. 23, publicly traded banks can now start developing their own Bitcoin-backed loan services.\u00a0\nBitcoin-backed loans allow users to unlock the trapped liquidity of their BTC holdings without forcing them to sell their coins, and it can help investors avoid taxable events.\u00a0\nBitcoin investor Mark Harvey noted that Bitcoin-backed loans give investors the option to implement the so-called \u201cbuy, borrow, die\u201d strategy.\u00a0\nAccording to Harvey\u2019s calculations, by posting 1 BTC as collateral at a conservative 10% loan-to-value ratio, an investor could get $9,784 in cash in the first year. If the investor borrows against the growing value of his BTC each year\u2014assuming a 50% annual appreciation\u2014his cash flow would balloon to $164,000 over a decade. A cunning cycle designed to maximize gains while keeping taxes at bay.\nBitcoin-backed loan calculations. Source: @thepowerfulHRV on X\nFrom a lender\u2019s perspective, using Bitcoin as collateral can help reduce idiosyncratic risks. Newmarket Capital CEO Andrew Hohns told CNBC that it is a novel lending strategy used by his firm. Newmarket Capital lent money to a real estate owner who used a part of it to purchase Bitcoin, then added it as additional collateral. This move provided the lender with enhanced protection and a more diversified risk profile.\n\u201cBy fusing Bitcoin with credit and traditionally financeable assets, it gives us the luxury of expressing that medium-term view on Bitcoin.\u201d\nCurrently, there are around 20 service providers that allow users to borrow stablecoins and fiat using Bitcoin as collateral. CeFi firms like Wirex, Nexo, Bitcoin Suisse, and DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound also allow investors to supply wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) as collateral.\nCrypto-backed loans provided by CeFi firms boomed from 2019 to 2022 before misuse and theft of customer funds were exposed and led to the downfall of Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager Digital. DeFi-based loans offer greater transparency compared to other options but come with their own set of challenges like smart contract vulnerabilities, a lack of regulation and hidden leverage through poorly managed rehypothecation strategies.\nRelated: MicroStrategy may owe taxes on $19B unrealized Bitcoin gains: Report\nWhile many people praise Bitcoin loan services, others are still wary.\nBitcoin investor and self-proclaimed \u201cvalue maximalist\u201d Brad Mills shared in an X post that he hasn\u2019t used any Bitcoin loan services despite investing in companies that develop them. He explained that he values his Bitcoin holdings more than his equity in Bitcoin businesses.\nBitcoiner @btc_overflow has also expressed his skepticism:\nBitcoiners express skepticism over BTC-backed loans. Source: @btc_overflow on X\nUntil Jan. 23, most major banks were unable to offer Bitcoin-backed loans. This limitation stemmed from the SEC\u2019s accounting guidance, SAB 121, which required listed companies to disclose crypto assets held on behalf of clients as liabilities on their balance sheets.\u00a0\nFor banks, this complicated matters, as capital requirements are tightly linked to balance sheet contents. Although both the US House and Senate voted to overturn SAB 121, former President Biden vetoed the decision, leaving the rule intact (albeit granting some exceptions to BNY Mellon).\u00a0\nOn Jan. 23, the SEC officially rescinded this controversial guidance. This marks a significant shift and a potential opening for banks to enter the Bitcoin-backed loan market.\nAdditionally, Coinbase's legal team clarified that the FDIC was compelled to further un-redact the \u201cpause letters\u201d sent to banks in 2022 and 2023. In a thread on X, Nic Carter listed 25 FDIC documents requesting banks to halt various Bitcoin-related operations.\nThe recent pro-crypto turn among US legislators is likely to lead to increased Bitcoin exposure among America\u2019s major banks. This will not only increase crypto adoption but also likely result in reduced sell pressure on Bitcoin and help to drive its price higher. From a user and investor perspective, a larger Bitcoin loan market could lead to more competitive rates and improved loan conditions.\u00a0\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": " It will take more than Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Pectra upgrade to turn ETH price around. Cointelegraph explains why. \nEther (ETH) price fell below $3,500 on Jan. 7 and has since struggled to trade above that level. The altcoin has declined by 8% over the past 30 days, while the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 6%. This underperformance is concerning for Ether investors, especially with the launch of the spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in July 2024.\nEther/USD vs. total crypto capitalization. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph\nTraders' disappointment comes after a period of average Ethereum transaction fees exceeding $2, steady growth in the ETH supply, significant criticism regarding the lack of support from the Ethereum Foundation, and memecoin trading shifting to competitor blockchains, particularly Solana.\u00a0\nThree factors could potentially push Ether above $3,500, although some depend on external elements such as regulatory changes.\nThe initial excitement brought by the election of the crypto-friendly United States President Donald Trump quickly faded after the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin on the Solana network. The token traded over $12 billion in volume during the first 48 hours, and its market capitalization rose above $14 billion, leading to a substantial influx of new users on Solana.\nPresident Trump endorsed the TRUMP memecoin through social media posts, surprising Ether investors since previous non-fungible tokens (NFTs) related to Trump\u2019s conglomerate had been launched on Ethereum. However, Ether\u2019s price was already underperforming after increasing by 26.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, while the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization grew by 44.6%.\nEther\u2019s bearish momentum follows increased competition in onchain activity and deposits.\u00a0\nTotal value locked (TVL) market share. Source: DefiLlama\nFor example, Solana became the leading blockchain in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, while Tron captured a 28% market share in the stablecoin sector. Additionally, Ethereum's significant investment in layer-2 scalability using rollups had unintended effects, such as relatively empty blocks.\nFor Ether to surpass the $3,500 resistance level, investors need greater clarity on the effects of the upcoming Pectra upgrade, scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. The proposed changes introduce a unified framework for enhanced interoperability, secure wallet transitions, and simplified storage management. Ether investors believe that, despite good intentions, the development pace is insufficient to generate adequate fees from the layer-2 ecosystem.\u00a0\nConsequently, the upgrade will unlikely provide a significant positive impact on Ethereum's native staking yield or base layer scalability. As long as competing chains continue to extract more value from their users, the ETH price will remain under pressure.\nEthereum layer-2 aggregate TVL, USD. Source: L2Beat\nAnother concern for Ether bulls is the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum layer-2 solutions, which declined by 25% after reaching an all-time high of $65.3 billion on Dec. 8, 2024. Despite increased activity, competition for the Ethereum ecosystem is intensifying from all directions, not just from BNB Chain and Solana. For example, Hyperliquid Chain has attracted $1.2 billion in deposits for its perpetual futures exchange.\nRelated: Trump expands crypto footprint, gives memecoin utility for merch purchases\nSimilarly, competition for users and deposits has emerged from networks such as SUI, Aptos, and TON. While these may not pose a direct threat, they are well-funded and target niche markets like Web3 gaming, social networks, digital collectibles, and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Ultimately, data shows that Ethereum's higher security is not the main driver for adoption.\nEther\u2019s success depends on spot Ether ETF inflows, which have not seen $150 million or higher inflows since Jan. 16. Institutional demand for ETH-listed instruments has been disappointing, partly due to the lack of staking capability. Therefore, regulatory changes and the eventual approval of spot Ether ETF options on CME and CBOE could support the Ether price.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 20-day exponential moving average ($101,393) is flattening out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint, signaling a slight advantage to the bulls. Any upmove is expected to face resistance at $105,500 and then at $109,588. If the overhead resistance is cleared, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $118,109 and then to $126,706.\nContrarily, a break and close below the 50-day SMA will suggest that the bulls have given up. That could sink the pair to $90,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $90,000 to $85,000 zone.\u00a0\nEther (ETH) has been trading below the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern, but the bears have failed to extend the fall to $2,850. This suggests a lack of selling at lower levels.\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe bulls are trying to start a recovery, which is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($3,272). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to $2,850. Buyers are expected to defend the level with all their might because a break below it may sink the pair to $2,400.\nThis negative view will be invalidated in the short term if the price closes above $3,525 and the pair could then climb to $3,745.\nThe long tail on XRP\u2019s (XRP) Jan. 27 candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels, while the long wick on the Jan. 28 candlestick suggests selling near the downtrend line.\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2.94) and the RSI above 60 indicate that buyers have the upper hand. A break and close above the downtrend line will improve the prospects of a rally to $4 and then to $4.84.\nAlternatively, if the price turns down sharply from the downtrend line, it will signal that bears remain active at higher levels. Sellers will again attempt to sink the XRP/USDT pair to the 50-day SMA ($2.57).\nSolana (SOL) broke below the 20-day EMA ($230) on Jan. 27 but is finding support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $217.\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. If the price closes above the 20-day EMA, the SOL/USDT pair could rise to $244 and later to $260.\nOn the downside, a break and close below the 50-day SMA ($212) will tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could descend to $200 and later to the solid support at $180.\nBNB (BNB) rebounded off the $635 support on Jan. 27, indicating that bulls are attempting to keep the price inside the range.\nBNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe relief rally is likely to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages and breaks below $659, it will clear the path for a retest of $635. A break below the support could sink the BNB/USDT pair to $593.\nAlternatively, if the price rises above the moving averages, it will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the $635 to $745 range for a few more days. Buyers will be back in the driver\u2019s seat on a close above $745.\u00a0\nDogecoin (DOGE) closed below the ascending channel pattern on Jan. 28, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels.\nDOGE/USDT daily chart.

The bulls are again trying to push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the possibility of a rally toward $27.41 increases.\nConversely, if the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below $22, it will signal that the bears have the upper hand. The LINK/USDT pair could descend to the strong support at $20.\nAvalanche (AVAX) has declined to the $30.59 to $32.31 support zone, where the buyers are expected to mount a strong defense.\nAVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that the bears hold the edge. Sellers will try to stall the recovery attempts at the 20-day EMA ($36.26). If the price turns down sharply from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the risk of a break below $30.59 increases. The next support on the downside is at $25.\nIf buyers want to prevent the downside, they will have to push and maintain the AVAX/USDT pair above the moving averages. That opens the doors for a rally to the 50-day SMA ($39.58).\nStellar (XLM) is trying to stay above the $0.39 support, but the lack of a strong rebound increases the risk of a breakdown.\nXLM/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.42) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price continues lower from the current level and breaks below $0.39, the XLM/USDT pair could nosedive toward a significant support at $0.31.\nOn the other hand, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests that the bulls are trying to form a floor at $0.39. The pair may then rise to $0.45 and subsequently to $0.50.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": " XRP price shows signs of topping out after rallying to its record high, akin to its 2018 correction, while a bull flag target of $4.60 remains in play. \nXRP\u2019s (XRP) price has dropped by 4% over the last day and was trading for as low as $3.02 on Jan. 29.\nXRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nLet\u2019s examine whether XRP\u2019s price could drop further in the coming days.\nXRP chart fractal highlights the similarities between the ongoing price trend and that recorded between Dec. 1, 2024, and Jan. 10, 2025, when the price consolidated within a symmetrical triangle. The technical setup suggests a breakout in either direction, with bears eyeing a potential move toward the $2.50 demand zone.\nKey points to note:\nSymmetrical triangles, marked by converging trendlines connecting higher lows and lower highs, are considered to be neutral and can signal either a bullish or a bearish situation.\u00a0\nA breakout from the pattern in either direction signals a new trend.\nAs of Jan. 10, XRP is trading near the triangle\u2019s lower trendline, which, if breached, could lead to deeper corrections.\u00a0\nThis means a decline toward the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA, the yellow wave) at $2.57 or the bearish target of the triangle at $2.50.\nThis would represent about an 18% drawdown from the current price levels.\nXRP/USD daily chart. Source: Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThis downside target is measured after subtracting the triangle\u2019s maximum height from the potential breakdown point at the triangle\u2019s lower trendline at $3.00.\nConversely, a clear break above the triangle\u2019s upper trendline could send XRP toward $3.75, measured by adding the triangle\u2019s maximum height to the potential breakout point at around $3.20.\nHowever, XRP\u2019s market favors the bears, primarily due to signs that the number of wallets holding XRP has been on a downward trend for over a month now.\nThe data shows:\u00a0\nXRP active addresses have dropped from a three-year high of 108,771 on Dec. 2, 2024, to 40,292 on Jan. 28.\u00a0\nThis metric has declined by over 39% over the last 10 days alone, accompanying an approximately 10% price drop over the same period.\nXRP in addresses with at least 1M balance. Source: CryptoQuant\nThis implies that XRP holders have been booking profits following the rally to seven-year highs of $3.40.\nIf the trend continues, XRP price could drop lower before initiating another recovery.\nRelated: XRP price targets $15 amid enthusiasm over CME futures launch\nXRP, nevertheless, remains in line with a bullish continuation pattern that indicates a potential rebound ahead despite the ongoing consolidation.\nKey points:\nXRP still trades within a bull flag pattern, indicating the possibility of regaining bullish momentum if key support levels hold.\nXRP/USD daily price chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe bull flag developed after XRP\u2019s rally from $2.27 to a local high of $3.40 between Jan. 10 and Jan. 16.\nThe consolidation within the bull flag has XRP trading in a descending parallel channel, with today\u2019s recovery nearing critical support levels, including the upper boundary of the flag at $3.30.\nA breakout above this level could trigger another rally.\nThe bull flag\u2019s upside target, derived from the height of the previous rally, is approximately $4.60, representing a 52% uptick from the current price.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": " From digital red packets to memecoins, Bitcoin continues its love affair with Lunar New Year in 2025. \nLunar New Year has become a global celebration and a surprisingly positive period for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto \u2014 replete with modernizing the hongbao (financial gifts in red envelopes), memecoins bearing the year\u2019s zodiac animal and increased trading activities in Asian hours.\nSo far, 2025 appears to be following the trend. Ahead of Jan. 29, crypto exchanges are rewarding users with so-called digital red packets, while serpent-themed memecoins are dominating the chains. And, right on time, Bitcoin trading activity has begun tipping to Asian trading hours.\nBitcoin\u2019s trading volume was heavily skewed toward Western trading hours in the week of Jan. 14, which accounted for 56.15% of activity, compared to 43.85% during Eastern trading hours, IntoTheBlock data shows.\nIn the following seven days, Eastern trading volume jumped to 46.45%, with Western hours slipping to 53.54%. The split was nearly even on the final day of the period \u2014 49.55% for the East and 50.45% for the West.\u00a0\nBitcoin trading volumes in East and West even out heading into the Lunar New Year. Source: IntoTheBlock\nRelated: How We Will Remember the Year of the Dog? ICO Market Decline, Trend Toward Compliance and Other Takeaways\nThe surge in Eastern trading volume leading up to the Lunar New Year echoes a long-standing pattern identified by digital assets service firm Matrixport.\nHistorically, January is Bitcoin\u2019s second-worst month, as it\u2019s down an average of 1% over the past decade, second only to September\u2019s 3% drop.\nBy contrast, February\u2019s average 14% gain trails only October\u2019s 23% \u2014 a performance so reliable that the crypto community has dubbed the month \u201cUptober.\u201d\nBitcoin\u2019s success rate throughout Lunar New Years. Source: Matrixport\nLunar New Year dates vary yearly but generally fall in late January or early February. According to Matrixport, Bitcoin\u2019s track record during this festive period is one of its most consistent. In the 10 days before and after Lunar New Year, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has logged an average gain of 21.1%.\nIn its report, Matrixport said:\n\u201cBitcoin has delivered positive returns during the Chinese New Year in 11 of the past 12 years, resulting in a statistically impressive 83% success rate for generating gains during this period.\u201d\nOn Jan. 27, Bitcoin fell below $100,000 for the first time since US President Donald Trump was elected. Chinese AI app DeepSeek rapidly rose to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store rankings, which rattled investors and intensified fears of an AI arms race between the world\u2019s top economies. Bitcoin has since bounced back above the six-digit mark, just a day before the Lunar New Year.\nThe 2024 calendar opened with a major milestone for cryptocurrency, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time. The landmark decision signaled a new level of institutional acceptance for digital assets on American soil.\nBy 2025, however, the spotlight had shifted to a flood of memecoins \u2014 fueled in part by Trump\u2019s own crypto ventures. The president launched his own memecoin, followed by the First Lady\u2019s token.\nRelated: US CBDC \u2018is dead\u2019 under Trump, but stablecoins could be set to explode\nMeanwhile, the Lunar New Year brought on its own wave of speculative mania tied to the Year of the Snake, the sixth of 12 animals portrayed in the Chinese zodiac cycle. Several snake-themed tokens have hit the market, aimed at investors or, in some cases, unwitting victims.\nSnake-themed tokens slither into Solana markets. Source: Birdseye\nOne notable Solana-based token, \u201cThe Year of the Snake,\u201d briefly reached a $1.7 million market cap before tumbling below $1 million. Another Ethereum-based offering called \u201cChinese New Year\u201d dominated Dextool\u2019s rankings on Jan. 28, soaring a ridiculous 119,194%, peaking at $7 million in market cap.\nGifting money during Lunar New Year is a long-standing tradition across East Asia, symbolizing respect, prosperity and good fortune.\nIn South Korea\u2019s Seollal celebration, younger generations perform a formal bow, known as jeol, to honor their elders. In return, they receive crisp bills, often presented in envelopes.\nIn China, money is gifted in red envelopes, with the color representing luck and prosperity. This deeply rooted tradition has adapted to the digital age.\nThe Chinese government has embraced the concept of digital red packets, leveraging its central bank digital currency (CBDC) to modernize the practice. Despite Beijing\u2019s anti-crypto stance, it has airdropped digital yuan red packets to promote the adoption of its CBDC, considered one of the most advanced digital fiats globally.\nCorporations have also capitalized on the tradition. Crypto exchanges like Crypto.com are distributing Bitcoin in digital red packets to users during this Lunar New Year season.\nMagazine: Big moves expected for crypto in Asia in 2025: Asia Express",

        "title": " 3 things must happen for Solana (SOL) price to rebound to new all-time highs ",
        "content": " Unsustainable memecoin frenzies, global uncertainty and investors\u2019 risk-averse positioning could complicate Solana\u2019s chances of hitting new all-time highs. \nSolana\u2019s native token SOL (SOL) saw its price drop by 17.2% between Jan. 24 and Jan. 27. After touching its lowest levels in 10 days, the price recovered to $235, but this is still 26% below its Jan. 19 all-time high of $295. This recent downturn partially reflects a 40% decline in Solana\u2019s network onchain trading activity. Despite the short-term weakness, SOL has the potential for further gains in 2025.\n7-day onchain trading volumes rank, USD. Source: DefiLlama\nSolana\u2019s competitors have shown more resilience. BNB Chain volumes dropped by just 1%, while Ethereum\u2019s base layer saw a 10% reduction in activity over seven days. However, it\u2019s important to note that other competitors and Ethereum layer-2 solutions also reported 25% to 30% lower onchain volumes during the same period.\nNegative highlights within Solana\u2019s ecosystem include Meteora, down 45% in volumes; Orca, down 62%; and Lifinity, which experienced a 53% decline in activity. Conversely, the Pump.fun memecoin launchpad was a bright spot, achieving a 24% increase in volume over the same timeframe. Solana's Raydium platform remained the leader, recording $35.1 billion in weekly onchain activity.\nIt would be misleading to evaluate SOL\u2019s potential upside based solely on Solana\u2019s onchain activity, which is heavily driven by decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Activities like staking, lending, and real-world assets (RWA) applications often don\u2019t generate consistent onchain volumes. Therefore, total value locked (TVL) provides a more comprehensive measure of network usage.\nTotal value locked (TVL) rank, USD. Source: DefiLlama\nThe TVL on Solana increased by 27% in the 30 days ending Jan. 28, significantly outperforming Ethereum, which declined by 9%, and BNB Chain, which slipped by 1%. This growth solidified Solana\u2019s second-place position in the market, widening the gap with Tron. Notable contributors include Jito and Raydium, which saw deposits rise by 29%, and Binance Staked SOL, which grew by an impressive 52% during the month.\nEthereum\u2019s recent activity decline can be linked to weaker performances in Lido, EigenLayer, and Ether.fi. Notably, staking platform EigenLayer, launched in June 2023, holds $13.6 billion in total value locked (TVL), surpassing the entire Solana ecosystem\u2019s deposits. This highlights Ethereum's dominance and shows that some investors remain willing to pay $5 or higher transaction fees.\nTo understand Solana traders\u2019 sentiment, it\u2019s crucial to examine the monthly SOL futures contracts premium. Futures contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium over spot markets to account for their longer settlement periods. A premium above 10% indicates strong bullish sentiment, while levels below 5% suggest weaker buyer confidence.\nSOL 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\nOn Jan. 27, SOL futures briefly spiked to a 12% annualized premium but quickly dropped back to 6%. This relatively low premium, despite a 21% price rally over the past 30 days, suggests a lack of enthusiasm among investors. Some analysts argue that recent SOL price gains were largely driven by memecoins and the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) token.\nRelated: Nvidia slump and $100B crypto IPOs could fuel Bitcoin rally\nRegardless of whether risk aversion stems from uncertainties in global economies or stock markets, the odds of SOL reaching a new all-time high in the short term appear slim. Some analysts point out that recent SOL price gains were largely driven by memecoins and the Official Trump (TRUMP) launch.\nPotential drivers for SOL\u2019s future price appreciation include the migration of stablecoins from Tron to Solana and the increasing adoption of Web3 applications, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector. \nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Over the past 24 hours, the crypto asset has consolidated above the six-figure range, as the market braced itself for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. \nTarget Rate probabilities for Jan. 29 Fed meeting.

Further rate cuts will depend on whether new data suggests economic weakness and lower inflation. \nFor the better part of four weeks, multiple analysts believed that the markets have already \u201cpriced in\u201d unchanged interest rates.

Source: X.com\nByzantine General, a futures market analyst, had a similar opinion, expecting BTC prices to possibly retest the $94,000 to $92,000 before the FOMC meeting. \nRelated: Bitcoin far from 'extreme' FOMO at above $100K BTC price \u2014 Research\nOne key difference between the previous and upcoming FOMC meeting is that this will be the first Fed gathering under Trump\u2019s administration. Last week, the 47th US president publicly demanded that the Federal Reserve should consider cutting interest rates, citing declining oil prices. \nAdditionally, Tomas, a macroeconomics analyst, also said that it is \u201chard to believe\u201d that Powell will be more hawkish relative to the December 2024 press conference. The analyst said,\nHence, this outlook may not be \u201cpriced in,\u201d according to market commentators.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nA 4-hour candle close above equal high (EQHs) at $107,000 would take BTC above the descending trendline resistance as illustrated in the chart, and a confirmed break of structure (BOS) will be attained. \nThis would allow Bitcoin to move toward another all-time high value above $110,000, with the crypto asset entering another price discovery period in February. \nRegardless, it should be noted that the Federal Reserve is an independent entity, and it does not need to consider the US President\u2019s opinion.

        "title": " Bitcoin price drops under $98K as markets sell-off following DeepSeek AI launch ",
        "content": " Bitcoin price fell to $97,754 as crypto and stock markets digested the significance of a China-based ChatGPT AI competitor called DeepSeek. \nBitcoin (BTC) experienced a surprising 7% correction on Jan. 27, briefly dropping below $98,000 for the first time in over 10 days. Regardless of the factors driving this movement, Bitcoin\u2019s price is struggling to reclaim the $100,000 support level, prompting traders to question whether the bullish momentum has dissipated.\nBitcoin derivatives metrics remained stable despite the $7,320 price drop to $97,754, suggesting that whales and arbitrage desks were prepared for the downturn. However, stablecoin metrics from Chinese markets indicate that cryptocurrency demand in the region remains subdued.\nThe Bitcoin futures annualized premium, which measures how monthly contracts trade relative to the spot market, provides a key insight into leverage demand. Premium levels between 5% and 10% are considered neutral, while values above this range reflect optimism.\nBitcoin futures 2-month annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s temporary dip to its lowest level in 10 days, the BTC futures premium consistently stayed above the 10% neutral threshold. This suggests no signs of panic selling or significant demand for bearish leveraged positions (shorts).\nSimilarly, Bitcoin options skew, which measures the price difference between call (buy) and put (sell) options, was largely unaffected by the price drop. In neutral markets, the 25% delta skew typically ranges between -6% and +6%, with values below that indicating bullish sentiment.\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew, put-call. Source: Laevitas.ch\nThe BTC options skew briefly shifted from -7% to -2%, moving out of bullish territory. However, professional traders quickly adjusted their positions, bringing the metric back to -6%, near the boundary of a neutral-to-bullish market. More importantly, the dip below $98,000 did not trigger excessive downside hedging demand, demonstrating resilience in the derivatives market.\nTo assess whether sentiment is limited to Bitcoin derivatives, it is crucial to analyze stablecoin demand in China. When traders exit cryptocurrency markets, USD Tether (USDT) typically trades at a discount to the official Yuan exchange rate. Conversely, during bull runs, stablecoins can trade at a 1.5% or higher premium.\nUSD Tether (USDT) trades vs. official USD/CNY rate. Source: OKX\nCurrently, USD Tether is trading at a 0.7% discount to the official USD/CNY rate, signaling moderate selling pressure. However, this represents an improvement from recent days when USDT traded at a 1.5% discount. This trend has been noticeable since Jan. 19, shortly after Bitcoin reclaimed the $105,000 level, following 30 days below this resistance.\nData from derivatives markets shows that professional traders remain cautiously optimistic and relatively comfortable with Bitcoin above $100,000. However, overall cryptocurrency demand in China remains weak. Likely, external factors are weighing on sentiment.\nRelated: Bitcoin could top $150K before retrace in repeat of 2017 cycle, says analyst\nOne such factor is the emerging signs of a global economic slowdown, which has led investors to shy away from riskier assets. Additionally, weakness in artificial intelligence stocks on Dec. 27, triggered by competition from the Chinese AI company DeepSeek, has fueled a sell-off. Although Bitcoin historically shows a low correlation with tech stocks, rising uncertainty in traditional markets has led traders to reduce risk.\nFor long-term Bitcoin investors, the outlook remains \u201chalf full.\u201d Eventually, investors are likely to turn to scarce assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against inflationary central bank policies. However, in the short term, the likelihood of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high appears low.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The fall was triggered by the rapid rise of China-based AI app DeepSeek, which stoked fears of rising competition in the AI sector.

The world\u2019s largest corporate Bitcoin holder acquired 10,107 Bitcoin at an average price of $105,596 between Jan. 21 and Jan. 26.\nCould Bitcoin stay above $100,000, or will bears pull the price lower? How are the altcoins positioned? Let\u2019s analyze the charts to find out.\nThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) gapped down sharply on Jan. 27, indicating that the markets rejected the breakout above 6,100.\nSPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 20-day exponential moving average (5,985) is the crucial support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off this support, it will signal that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will again try to push the price above 6,100, starting the journey toward the target objective of 6,347.\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price closes below the moving averages. That may trap the aggressive bulls, resulting in a drop to the 5,853 to 5,773 support zone.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) has pulled below the 50-day simple moving average (107.58), indicating that the bears are trying to make a comeback.\nDXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nSellers will try to sink the price to 106.69, which is likely to act as near-term support. A bounce off 106.69 could face selling at the 20-day EMA (108.25). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the index may drop to the solid support at 105.42.\nIf buyers want to prevent the downside, they will have to swiftly drive the price above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will signal that the correction may be over. The index may climb toward 109.46.\nBitcoin plunged below the moving averages on Jan. 27, but the bulls are trying to defend the 50-day SMA ($99,382).\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nBoth moving averages are flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If the price rises and maintains above the 20-day EMA ($101,086), the bulls will again try to drive the BTC/USDT pair to $109,588.\nConversely, a close below the 50-day SMA will open the doors for a fall to the support of the range at $90,000. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the $90,000 to $85,000 zone because a break below it will signal that the pair may have topped out in the short term.\nEther (ETH) slipped below the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern on Jan. 27. If the price closes below the neckline, the setup will be complete.\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe ETH/USDT pair could decline to $2,850, which is likely to act as a formidable support. If the price rebounds off $2,850 but turns down from the 20-day EMA ($3,308), it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. That increases the risk of a break below $2,850. If that happens, the pair may drop to $2,400.\nTime is running out for the bulls. If they want to limit the downside, they will have to quickly push the price back above the 50-day SMA ($3,455). The pair may then rally to $3,745.\nXRP (XRP) continued lower and broke below the breakout level of $2.91 on Jan. 27, indicating profit booking at higher levels.\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows solid buying near the 50-day SMA ($2.54). If the price sustains above $2.91, the bulls will try to thrust the XRP/USDT pair to the downtrend line. A break and close above the downtrend line will improve the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend.\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and tumbles below the 50-day SMA, it will signal that the bulls are losing their grip. That could accelerate selling, and the pair may fall to $2.20 and, after that, to $2.\nRepeated failure to maintain Solana (SOL) above $260 may have tempted short-term traders to book profits.\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe SOL/USDT pair turned down sharply on Jan. 26 and broke below the 20-day EMA ($231) on Jan. 27. The pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($211), which is expected to act as strong support. However, the bears are unlikely to give up and will try to sell the rallies. If the 50-day SMA cracks, the pair may dive to $200 and then to $180.\nThis negative view will be invalidated if the price maintains above the 20-day EMA. That will indicate solid demand at lower levels. The pair may then attempt a rally to $260.\nBNB (BNB) turned down and broke below the uptrend line on Jan. 27 but bounced back from the $635 support.\nBNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe relief rally is expected to face stiff resistance at the uptrend line and then again at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will signal that the bears have the upper hand. That increases the risk of a break below $635. The pair may then drop to $593.\nContrarily, if the price rises above the moving averages, it will suggest that the BNB/USDT pair may remain range-bound between $635 and $745 for a few more days.\nRelated: Bitcoin price bounces 5%, cancels DeepSeek stocks dive as $102K returns\nDogecoin (DOGE) broke below the ascending channel pattern on Jan. 27, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge.\nDOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThere is solid support at $0.30, but if the level breaks down, the DOGE/USDT pair could descend to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.27 and eventually to the breakout level of $0.23. Such a deep correction will suggest that the pair may have topped out in the near term.\nIf buyers want to make a comeback, they will have to push and sustain the price above the moving averages. The pair may ascend to $0.40 and later to $0.43.\nCardano (ADA) closed below the uptrend line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on Jan. 26, indicating that the uncertainty resolved in favor of the bears.\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe bulls are defending the support at $0.87, but the recovery is expected to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, it will suggest that bears remain in control. That increases the possibility of a drop to $0.80 and subsequently to $0.76.\nThe first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA ($0.98). The ADA/USDT pair may then attempt a rally to the resistance line.\nChainlink\u2019s (LINK) failure to rise above the $27.41 overhead resistance may have attracted profit booking by short-term traders.\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe LINK/USDT pair dropped below the moving averages, but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels. If the price maintains above the moving averages, the bulls will make another attempt to propel the pair above $27.41. If they succeed, the pair could rise to $31.\nOn the contrary, a close below the moving averages will indicate a range-bound action between $20 and $27.41 for some more time.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: Coin360\nToday\u2019s downturn in the crypto market comes after the\u00a0release of DeepSeek R1\u00a0by the Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, which has had a notable impact\u00a0on the prices of AI-related tokens.\nDeepseek R1 is AI's Sputnik moment.\nDubbed by Marc Andreessen as \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment,\u201d DeepSeek R1 is an open-source artificial intelligence, large-language model that has shattered long-held assumptions about AI development.\nRelated: DeepSeek rout costs bulls $100K \u2014 5 Things to know in Bitcoin this week\nDeepSeek matches or surpasses the performance of leading models like those from OpenAI, all while being built on a budget of $6 million and a fraction of the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that OpenAI uses, as per data from machine learning resource Hugging Face.\u00a0\nMoreover, it is open-source and requires much less computing power, allowing it to run on a smartphone. This has triggered a risk-off mode among AI-related stocks and crypto AI tokens.\nNotably, Render (RENDER) led the losses with a drop of 14.6%.

The trading volume has increased by more than 38% in 24 hours to $3.41 billion, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side pressure.\nA wave of leveraged liquidations has accompanied the crypto market\u2019s downturn today. Leverage allows traders to borrow funds to increase their trading position, amplifying both potential gains and losses.\u00a0\nWhen the market moves against these positions, especially in a highly volatile environment like crypto, it can lead to a cascade of liquidations.\u00a0\nThe latest data indicates that the crypto market has seen nearly $853 million in liquidations over the last 24 hours, with $794 million being long liquidations. $247.95 million in long Bitcoin (BTC) positions have been liquidated, with the tally continuing at the time of publication.\u00a0\nTotal crypto liquidations.

This suggests that the market sentiment is shifting in favor of the bears.\nIf the selling intensifies, the crypto market will likely drop toward the $3.20 trillion psychological support.

Note that this has been a dynamic support trendline for TOTAL since Nov. 21.\nTOTAL/USD daily chart.

The flattening 20-EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\u00a0\nA break and close above $107,250 could push the pair to the overhead resistance of $109,588. If this level is cleared, the pair may climb to $119,176. On the downside, a break and close below $100,000 could sink the pair to $90,000.\nSolana (SOL) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the $260 level.\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($232) and the RSI above 65 indicate buyers are in command. A close above $273 could open the doors for a rise to $296. This level may pose a strong challenge, but if cleared, the SOL/USDT pair could rise to $375.\nThis optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below $229. The pair may then drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($212) and eventually to $180.\nSOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe pair has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern on the four-hour chart, indicating uncertainty about the next directional move. The bulls will seize control on a break and close above the triangle. That could propel the pair to $296 and later to $312.\nOn the contrary, a break and close below the triangle will signal the start of a deeper correction. The pair may drop to the solid support at $229, but if this level gets taken out, the next stop may be at $206.\nChainlink (LINK) is facing selling at $27.41, but a positive sign is that the buyers have not ceded much ground to the sellers.\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 20-day EMA ($23.91) is turning up, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that the bulls have the edge. If the price rises above $27.41, the momentum could pick up, and the LINK/USDT pair may rally to $31 and subsequently to $33.36.\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to yank the price back below the moving averages. That will open the doors for a fall to the critical support at $20, where buyers are expected to step in.\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 4-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. If buyers push the price above the triangle, the pair could rally to $27.41. This level may act as a stiff barrier, but if buyers overcome it, the pair could climb to the pattern target of $28.81.\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the triangle. The pair may then slump to $22.19.\nRelated: Binance Bitcoin price 'gap' hits record as perps stay bearish at $105K\nMANTRA (OM) surged above the $4.63 overhead resistance on Jan. 26, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels.\nOM/USDT daily chart.

If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the pair could remain inside the $4.63 to $3.39 range for some more time.\nInstead, if the price closes above $4.63, it will indicate that the buyers are in control. The bulls will then try to overcome the barrier at $5.11, starting the next leg of the rally to $5.87 and, after that, to $6.32.\nOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price pulled back below the breakout level of $4.63, indicating that the bears have not given up. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $4.40 to $4.20 support zone. If the price rebounds off this zone and breaks above $4.63, the bulls will again attempt to thrust the pair above $5.11.\nConversely, a break and close below $4.20 will signal that the breakout above $4.63 may have been a bull trap.\u00a0\nRaydium (RAY) resumed its uptrend after breaking out of the $6.50 resistance on Jan. 18, indicating that bulls are in control.\nRAY/USDT daily chart.

If the price rises above $8, the pair could retest the $8.70 resistance. A break and close above this level could catapult the pair to $10.\nThe $6.50 level is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below $6.50 will suggest that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could pull the pair down to the 50-day SMA ($5.51).\nRAY/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe pair\u2019s pullback is finding support at the 50-SMA, indicating buying on dips. Buyers need to push and maintain the price above the 20-EMA to signal strength. The pair could rise to $8.31 and subsequently to $8.70.\nConversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will indicate that the bears are selling on rallies. That increases the risk of a fall to the breakout level of $6.50 and thereafter to $5.89.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Is this a net positive for the crypto sector? \nLarry Fink, CEO of the world\u2019s largest fund manager BlackRock, has expressed his hope that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will swiftly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks. During a CNBC interview on Jan. 23, Fink strongly endorsed digital assets, underscoring their potential to democratize investments.\nThe open question is whether this shift toward tokenizing traditional assets can benefit cryptocurrencies, which sectors might flourish, and which projects might face heightened competition.\nThere is no doubt that 24-hour worldwide trading and the transparency of blockchain technology bring advantages to assets such as bonds and stocks. However, this move relies on regulatory updates and approvals from relevant government agencies. More importantly, regulated assets may not align well with decentralized finance (DeFi).\nTokenizing bonds that produce stable yields could pose a challenge to stablecoins by providing a digital asset tied to real-world interest rates. This development would introduce new instruments into financial markets, competing for liquidity and user confidence as investors seek tangible returns.\nSimilarly, tokenized stocks like GameStop or AMC could function as onchain assets with volatile price fluctuations, backed by communities in a manner reminiscent of memecoins. This evolution might affect retail trading platforms as investors gravitate toward regulated but still speculative stock tokens rather than purely speculative memecoins.\nGameStop (GME) and AMC Networks (AMC) in 2021. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph\nThe integration of tokenized bonds and stocks also broadens the offerings on established DeFi platforms, potentially driving higher total value locked. It would impact decentralized exchanges and lending protocols, as they could incorporate traditional asset classes to create new revenue streams.\nBy tokenizing real-world assets, direct ownership and pricing data can be embedded within a token\u2019s native structure, reducing the need for external oracles. This shift also affects blockchain data providers, as onchain assets inherently include their own data.\nBasic decentralized oracles workflow. Source: Pontem Network\nThe tokenization of bonds and stocks greatly expands the pool of assets available for onchain derivatives, influencing decentralized exchanges and lending platforms looking to offer diverse markets. Synthetic tokens that mirror these securities could also bypass certain regulatory barriers, opening new opportunities for margin trading and yield generation.\nDespite these benefits, tokenized securities must navigate regulatory hurdles such as Know Your Customer (KYC) mandates, accredited investor restrictions, and securities law compliance. Region-specific rules and listing limitations hamper accessibility, while partial onchain data coverage still requires oracles.\nAdditionally, legal uncertainties and potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts can erode investor trust. As a result, many DeFi protocols are forced to impose stricter oversight, limiting the free-flow nature typically associated with cryptocurrencies and slowing widespread adoption.\nRelated: How private credit impacts DeFi yield \u2014 Clearpool CEO\nUS Senator Cynthia Lummis\u2019s appointment as chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets on Jan. 23 could accelerate legislation for stock and bond tokenization. Known for her pro-crypto stance, Lummis is expected to foster cooperation among the SEC, the Department of the Treasury, CFTC, FINRA, and state securities regulators.\nStill, one should consider BlackRock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s statements with caution since the firm holds a major interest in tokenizing real-world assets. Such changes could broaden the base of buyers for US-listed stocks and bonds, in which BlackRock is among the top investors. Moreover, the company might serve as an intermediary, handling custody or administrative functions.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

More importantly, SOL has climbed 34% year-to-date in 2025, while the broader altcoin market gained 10%. This upswing has largely been fueled by memecoin trading hype, especially after the Official Trump (TRUMP) token launch on Jan. 18.\nSOL may take longer than expected to move above $280, as several onchain and derivatives metrics have declined from their recent peaks. This trend does not prevent SOL from challenging its $295 all-time high reached on Jan. 19, but it does raise concerns about the durability of recent inflows. For example, Solana network fees dropped 67% to $11.7 million on Jan. 21, compared to Jan. 19.\nSolana network daily transaction fees, USD. Source: DefiLlama\nThe decline in Solana fees aligns with reduced trading activity on Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca, though overall levels remain above the previous week.

On the other hand, a break below $32.31 could sink the pair to $30 and later to $27.\nStellar (XLM) has stayed above the 50-day SMA ($0.42), but the bulls are struggling to sustain the bounce above the 20-day EMA ($0.43).\nXLM/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe bears are trying to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the 50-day SMA. If they do that, the XLM/USDT pair may dip to $0.39. This is a critical near-term support for the bulls to protect because a break below it may test the $0.31 level.\nContrarily, if the price turns up from the current level or bounces off $0.39, the bulls will again try to shove the pair above the neckline of the inverted H&S pattern. If they succeed, the pair could rally to the $0.61 to $0.64 resistance zone.\nSui (SUI) has been falling inside a descending channel pattern, indicating that the rallies are being sold into.\nSUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe bears will try to sink the price to the channel\u2019s support line, where the buyers are expected to step in. A solid bounce off the support line will suggest that the SUI/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the channel for some more time.\u00a0\nThe bulls will be back in control on a close above the channel. The pair may rise to $5.37 and eventually to $5.82. Conversely, a break and close below the channel could start a deeper correction to $3.50 and then $3.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": " DOGE price is down 5% today in the past 24 hours but several technical and onchain metrics suggest that Dogecoin could soon tag new all-time highs. \nDogecoin (DOGE) price has dropped over 3.5% in the last 24 hours to $0.3663, despite a recovery across the broader cryptocurrency market, which rose by around 3% in the same period to rest at $3.62 trillion.\u00a0\nAlthough DOGE currently trades 33% below the multi-year high of $0.4846 reached on Dec. 8, 2024, several factors support more upside for the world\u2019s largest memecoin.\nDOGE/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nOne of the primary drivers behind today\u2019s surge in Dogecoin\u2019s price is the significant increase in activity from whales\u2014investors who hold large amounts of the cryptocurrency.\u00a0\nWhale transactions involving Dogecoin have surged significantly within the last 24 hours. Data from Santiment shows an increase in whale activity by holders with balances between 10 million and one billion DOGE.\u00a0\nThe trend in the chart indicates that DOGE whale activity ticked up on Jan. 21. These whales added approximately 590 million DOGE tokens (worth about $214 million at current rates) over the last 24 hours, correlating with a rise in the memecoin\u2019s price over the same timeframe.\nNumber of wallets holding between 10M and 1B DOGE. Source: Santiment\nThis uptick in buying activity suggests that large investors accumulated DOGE when the price dipped to $0.33 on Jan. 21, suggesting that this cohort expects higher prices in the future. \nAlso boosting investor sentiment was the appearance of the Dogecoin logo on the website of the newly established US Department of Government Efficiency, known as D.O.G.E., which US President Donald Trump established in an executive order following his inauguration on Jan. 20.\u00a0\nDOGE's price jumped 13% within minutes of the website going live on Jan. 21.\nAlthough the website no longer displays the Dogecoin logo, the event brought unprecedented visibility to Dogecoin, associating it with a governmental initiative led by Elon Musk, who is known for his affinity toward the memecoin. \nMeanwhile, there is growing speculation around the potential filing and approval of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The crypto market has witnessed a wave of ETF filings following the resignation of the former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, leading to heightened anticipation that a DOGE ETF could be approved soon following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.\nSource: Cointelegraph\nBloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the DOGE ETF \u201ccould hit the market in early April\u201d once approved.\nRelated: Price analysis 1/20: SPX, DXY, BTC, TRUMP, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, LINK\nAn ETF approval would provide a regulated investment vehicle for traditional investors, potentially increasing Dogecoin\u2019s exposure and legitimacy in the broader financial world, thereby increasing demand and pushing the price higher.\nChandler, an independent crypto trader and investor, highlighted that DOGE\u2019s recent price action is part of an accumulation trend that has been in play since 2021.\nThe Mayer Multiple Bands shows that the price is right where it was in January 2021, \u201caccumulating between the yellow and orange lines,\u201d the analyst said, adding:\u00a0\nDOGE/USD weekly chart.

(RUM), a video-sharing platform, revealed that it had purchased its first Bitcoin (BTC) just ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration event on Jan. 20, noting that \u201cit won\u2019t be the last\u201d Bitcoin purchase for the company.\nSource: Chris Pavlovski\nThe announcement appeared nearly two months after Rumble confirmed its plans to allocate $20 million from its excess cash reserves to purchase Bitcoin. The company said that their purchase will depend primarily on the wider crypto market conditions, including BTC\u2019s price and their platform\u2019s cash needs.\nBitcoin established a new record high of over $109,000 on Jan. 20, just ahead of Trump\u2019s swearing-in as the 47th President of the United States. Some crypto pundits anticipate the price to reach $180,000 and beyond by 2025\u2019s end.\nRumble\u2019s foray into Bitcoin appears to be motivated by a combination of financial and strategic factors mentioned in MicroStrategy\u2019s playbook, namely, using Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and dollar devaluation.\nSource: X\nMicroStrategy has accumulated 450,000 BTC since 2020, amounting to over 2% of the total BTC supply. The Nasdaq-listed firm has effectively tied its corporate identity and stock performance to Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\nThat is reflected in the unique correlation between them and Bitcoin. Both MicroStrategy and Rumble have vastly outperformed BTC prices since announcing their Bitcoin acquisition strategies. \nTo illustrate, MSTR has risen by around 2,650% since buying its first Bitcoin in August 2020, outperforming BTC/USD, which has grown over 850% in the same period.\nMSTR vs. BTC/USD since MicroStrategy\u2019s first Bitcoin buy.

        "content": " Donald Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office has sparked renewed optimism for the future of Bitcoin adoption and the growth of the US cryptocurrency industry. \nBitcoin, memecoins and the future of the cryptocurrency industry sparked intense debate at the 2025 edition of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as US President Donald Trump marked his return to the Oval Office.\nDuring the sole cryptocurrency-themed session at this year\u2019s forum, industry leaders painted an optimistic outlook for the sector in the US despite the memecoin-driven frenzy centered around the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) token.\nThe World Economic Forum doesn't talk about Bitcoin - so I made sure that we did in 2025.I took the chance to ask if the US will adopt a Bitcoin strategic reserve during the 'Crypto at a Crossroads' session inside this year's WEF conference.Coinbase's Brian Armstrong remains\u2026 pic.twitter.com/KtxoZD20tg\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to a question from Cointelegraph during the session, affirming that the explosive performance of the TRUMP memecoin would not impede efforts to establish a Bitcoin (BTC) strategic reserve, an idea endorsed by Trump in 2024.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it undermined anything with the strategic Bitcoin reserve. That effort is still alive and well. Cynthia Lummis in the Senate in the US is really pushing that idea,\u201d Armstrong said.\nThe idea of establishing a Bitcoin reserve was touted by the likes of Lummis, Trump and MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor during the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee.\nArmstrong elaborated on the proposal for delegates at the WEF session.\n\u201cThere is a proposal for the US government to start to hold Bitcoin. Like many countries, the US government holds reserves in various assets like gold, oil or rare minerals like palladium,\u201d he said, adding:\nRelated: Trump family memecoins may trigger increased SEC scrutiny on crypto\nLesetja Kganyago, governor of the South African Reserve Bank, was the only non-crypto panelist.\nKganyago said it was unlikely that South Africa would follow suit if the US were to begin stockpiling Bitcoin and questioned the merits of such a decision.\u00a0\nHe pointed to South Africa\u2019s focus on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and blockchain utility over Bitcoin\u2019s use as a store of value.\n\u201cThere is a history to gold. There was once a gold standard. Currencies were pegged to gold. But if we now use Bitcoin, what about platinum, what about coal? Why don\u2019t we hold strategic beef reserves, mutton reserves, or apple reserves? Why Bitcoin,\u201d Kganyago said.\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong (center) on stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Source: Cointelegraph\nArmstrong responded by highlighting the core principles championed by Bitcoin proponents, authors and advocates in recent years.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a new idea but I think it\u2019s clear at this point that Bitcoin is a better form of money than gold. It is provably scarce, just like gold, but it\u2019s more portable and divisible. I would say it has higher utility and it was the best-performing asset of the last 10 years,\u201d Armstrong said.\nArmstrong emphasized Bitcoin\u2019s advantages over traditional reserve assets and suggested central banks could acquire more BTC than gold over time:\nRelated: Trump\u2019s first week in office: Will crypto regulation take a back seat?\nA significant portion of the session was spent unpacking the outcome of the US election and the impact of political donations and lobbying from the cryptocurrency sector.\nSkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said that the Democratic Party failed to have meaningful discourse and a clear stance on the future of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\u201cI was there when President Trump gave the speech at the Bitcoin conference. It was clear if he won the election, things were going to change in the industry. And if you were on the side of the Democrats trying to support them, I was astonished at their reluctance to understand what was actually going on,\u201d Scaramucci said.\n\u201cIf somebody does write a history of this era, it\u2019ll be the era where Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler got together for some unknown reason and\u00a0literally helped the Democrats lose the presidency, the House and the Senate,\u201d he added.\nStellar Foundation director Denelle Dixon said that the cryptocurrency industry had conceded that regulatory action in the US meant that they needed to look overseas to continue doing business.\n\u201cPart of the challenge to that is that the dollar is something that everybody wants and it\u2019s in such high demand. There wasn\u2019t an ability to ignore what was happening in the United States, even though none of us liked the regulatory environment.\u201d\nArmstrong added that \u201cthe Trump effect\u201d could not be denied and said the new presidency has given the cryptocurrency industry newfound optimism and room to breathe and grow in the US.\nMagazine: Trump\u2019s Bitcoin policy lashed in China, deepfake scammers busted: Asia Express",

        "content": " Bitcoin price bounces back above $106,000 as the US Dollar Index cools and markets react positively to Trump\u2019s economic agenda. \nCrypto and equities markets roared toward new highs on Jan. 21, with Bitcoin making up the bulk of the ground lost during its pullback the day before.\u00a0\nIn the US, stock markets were closed on Jan. 20 in observation of Martin Luther King Jr. day, but traders\u2019 optimism over what is believed to be a market and business-climate-friendly Trump presidency was reflected right at the opening bell.\u00a0\nThe US Dollar Index continued its decline, pulling back 1.27% from a Jan. 15, two-year high of 110 to currently trade slightly above 108. As 2024 came to a close and right at the start of 2025, market participants\u2019 anxiety over the incoming Trump administration and a handful of other geopolitical tensions were reflected by the sharp rise in US Treasury yields and the DXY. After the smooth transition from former President Biden to a self-declared economics-focused Trump cabinet, the DXY has cooled off, along side Treasury yields.\u00a0\nDXY vs BTC 3-day chart. Source: TradingView\nMultiple analysts, CEOs and investment fund managers have gone on the record and shared their optimistic views regarding President Trump\u2019s economic agenda. This optimism can clearly be seen in the S&P 500, DOW and QQQ which have gained 1.21%, 0.82% and 2.79%, respectively. A portion of the rebound in equities can also be attributed to investors\u2019 belief that Trump\u2019s initial plan to implement tariffs on multiple countries has cooled.\u00a0\nSPX, DOW and QQQ 3-day chart. Source: TradingView\u00a0\nFollowing the positive vibes seen across markets, Bitcoin (BTC) also rallied, gaining 3.8% to reach an intra-day high at $107,240. While BTC has failed to eclipse its Jan. 20 all-time high at $109,588, the rebound is likely welcome, especially after anxious investors voiced their disappointment over President Trump making no mention of crypto on Inauguration Day and the absence of an executive order related to a strategic Bitcoin reserve or crypto in general.\u00a0\nEven though Trump may have backtracked on his day 1 promises to the crypto community, many of whom donated millions of dollars to his campaign through lobbies and personal contributions, there was positive news that emerged from the White House on Jan. 21.\u00a0\nAs reported by Cointelegraph, the US Securities and Exchange Commission took the first step toward reforming US crypto regulatory policy on Jan. 21 by revealing a new crypto task force purposed to develop a new framework for digital assets. The task force is led by long-time crypto advocate Commissioner Hester Peirce and many investors are already pleased by the appointment of Commissioner Mark Uyeda, who is currently serving as the acting SEC chairman.\u00a0\nRelated: 80% of Bitcoin short-term holders back in profit as analyst says 'FOMO in full swing'\nBitcoin also appeared to react positively to commentary from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan who said the banks across the world would happily make crypto payments \u201ca real thing\u201d if regulations provided sufficient clarity to do so.\u00a0\nWhile being interviewed by CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Moynihan said,\u00a0\nTaken within a wider context, Moynihan\u2019s comments align with Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan, who has on multiple occasions predicted that \u201cCorporations buying Bitcoin is a much bigger deal than most people think.\u201d\nThe three sources of insatiable demand in 2025: Companies, ETFs, and Governments. https://t.co/vatSG6wxgF\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": " Ethereum Foundation infighting and drop in DApp volumes put cloud over ETH price ",
        "content": " ETH\u2019s price momentum slows amid leadership disputes at the Ethereum Foundation and Solana's expanding DApp market share. \nEther (ETH) has struggled to close above $3,500 since Jan. 7, signaling weakness even as the broader cryptocurrency market gained 6% during the same period. This underperformance can be partly attributed to a drop in the volume of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps), raising concerns among traders about whether ETH price will continue to lag behind.\nOnchain activity on Ethereum has significantly underperformed compared to its peers. Over a seven-day period, volumes dropped 38% to $36.5 billion, according to DappRadar.\u00a0\nTop blockchains ranked by 7-day DApps volumes, USD. Source: DappRadar\nIn contrast, activity on the BNB Chain surged by 112%, while Solana gained 36%. Notable declines on Ethereum included Balancer and Morpho, which fell by 65%, and Uniswap, where volumes dropped by 40%.\nAdding to Ethereum\u2019s challenges, it no longer ranks among the top five blockchains in weekly fees. Between Jan. 14 and Jan. 21, Ethereum generated just $46 million in fees. Solana, by comparison, collected $71 million in fees, and when combined with contributions from Raydium, Jito, and Meteora, its total reached $309 million during the same period, based on DefiLlama data.\nCriticism has grown over Ethereum\u2019s mechanism that favors layer-2 scaling solutions, especially rollups that use blob space and low-cost state bridging to aggregate transactions. Average transaction fees on Ethereum\u2019s base layer currently stand at $5.50, a level that many DApps find unsustainable.\nThe ongoing debate focuses on balancing low transaction costs with the need to adequately reward ETH staking. Proposed solutions include raising fees or reducing the inflation rate. Ethereum\u2019s leading scaling solutions \u2014 Base, Arbitrum, Polygon and Optimism \u2014 currently account for a combined $25.8 billion in weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\nWeekly DEX volumes, USD. Source: DefiLlama\nTo put things into perspective, Solana remains the leader in total onchain volumes, recording $118.6 billion in activity over 7 days, according to DefiLlama data. This surge was fueled by the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin on Jan. 18, a record-breaking token endorsed by US President Donald Trump. As a result, platforms like Raydium, Orca, and Meteora saw volume gains of 200% or more.\nDespite this, Ethereum retains its top position in total value locked, holding steady at $66 billion week-over-week, according to DefiLlama. Ethereum layer-2 solutions also grew to $8.2 billion in deposits across Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism. However, Solana deposits rose by 29% in just 7 days, reaching an all-time high of $11.2 billion, which has added pressure and uncertainty for ETH investors.\nRelated: Trump and Melania memecoins attract first-time investors \u2014 Survey\nFurther concerns among Ether holders stem from the internal debate within the Ethereum Foundation. In May, the foundation implemented a conflict-of-interest policy following criticism that some of its researchers took paid advisory roles at EigenLayer. More recently, on Jan. 21, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared sole authority over the foundation\u2019s leadership.\u00a0\nButerin responded to criticism on X, stating that leadership decisions would remain his responsibility until reforms establish a \u201cproper board.\u201d His comments followed significant backlash directed at Ethereum Foundation executive director Aya Miyaguchi, who has been accused of inefficiencies during her tenure since 2018.\nThese controversies, coupled with reduced staking incentives for ETH, have hindered Ethereum\u2019s market momentum. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has capitalized on the memecoin frenzy, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance. As a result, there appears to be no clear catalyst for Ether to outperform its competitors in the short term.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": " Trading Bitcoin can be tricky \u2014 Here\u2019s 3 key macroeconomic indicators worth following ",
        "content": " Knowing when to buy and when to sell Bitcoin can be nerve-racking for investors, but a BTC macro cheat sheet from Cane Island Digital could ease the process. \nWhen to buy and when to sell Bitcoin is a decision that continues to perplex investors to this day. A widening range of factors impact (BTC) price, and developing a methodology for consistently avoiding losses and generating a profit is essential for such a high-volatility asset.\u00a0\u00a0\nRecently, Bitcoin analyst and Cane Island Digital founder Timothy Peterson shared a cheat sheet encompassing 8 macroeconomic factors that impact Bitcoin price. Let\u2019s take a look at the top 3 metrics to understand how they correlate with Bitcoin price and offer insight into optimal buying and selling opportunities.\nThe DXY measures the US dollar value against a basket of major currencies. It is influenced by, among others, interest rates, geopolitics, domestic economic conditions, and foreign exchange reserves held in USD.\nA stronger DXY tends to negatively impact Bitcoin's price. Conversely, when confidence in the index wanes, investors turn to risk assets, equities and Bitcoin. This inverse correlation has been observed for years and continued through 2024, as shown in the recent NYDIG research.\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation with equities, gold, and USD. Source: NYDIG, Bloomberg\nSince September 2024, the DXY has been on an upward trajectory, reaching 110, its highest point in over two years. Some analysts think this presents a bearish outlook for Bitcoin. However, according to Michael Boutros, senior technical strategist at Forex.com, this rally is nearing a long-term resistance level. If this resistance holds, it could reverse the trend, potentially creating a more favorable environment for Bitcoin.\nSince its peak on Jan. 13, DXY has dipped 1.27%, but the incoming Trump presidency could reverse this trend, depending upon the policies of his cabinet.\u00a0\nFederal Reserve interest rates influence borrowing costs across the US. Decreasing rates make borrowing cheaper, boosting demand for risk-on assets. Conversely, rising rates tend to shift investor preference toward yield-bearing assets like bonds.\nBitcoin, too, is considered a risky asset. Researchers from the Swiss bank Piguet Galland have studied the correlation between BTC and interest rates over time.\nBitcoin Price and Federal Funds Rates Over Time. Source: Piguet Galland\nThe graph above shows that the inverse correlation emerged after the post-Covid interest rate cuts when BTC surged to a cycle high of almost $69,000. This was followed by sharp rate hikes in 2022, during which BTC dropped to a cycle low of $16,000. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin is still considered a risk-on asset.\u00a0\nIn addition to the Fed\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which typically meets eight times a year, other economic metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are also used by traders as inversely correlated data points that impact Bitcoin price versus the market\u2019s inflation expectations.\u00a0\nRelated: Bitcoin price still on track to $180K in 2025: Interview with Filbfilb\nWhen trading the monthly CPI release, market expectations often matter more than the raw numbers. For instance, the December 2024 CPI, which showed a 2.9% annual inflation rate, met market expectations. The Core CPI, excluding food and energy, came in at 3.2%, better than the anticipated 3.3%. Although still above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it brought some relief to the markets. Immediately following the news, the S&P 500 climbed 1.83%, the Nasdaq 100 2.3% and Bitcoin gained 4.3%.\nSo far, \u201cwith inflation, good news is good news\u201d for Bitcoin, as quantitative market analyst Benjamin Cowen put it. Decreasing inflation tends to push BTC upward. However, there\u2019s another side to Bitcoin \u2014 its role as digital gold, often touted as a hedge against inflation. In this paradigm, it is the increasing inflation that should drive BTC higher, as more people turn to Bitcoin to protect against the depreciating US dollar. As Bitcoin adoption grows, this scenario could materialize, inversing the current correlation.\nBond yields, directly correlated with the Fed's rates and inflation, serve as another valuable metric for Bitcoin traders. High yields on low-risk government bonds can reduce the appeal of riskier assets like Bitcoin that do not generate yield.\nUS 10-Year Treasury Note vs BTC/USD. Source: MarketWatch, Coinbase\nSince December 2024, yields on US long-term bonds have been rising, reaching 4.77%, the highest level since 2023. This increase has occurred despite the Fed's cautiously cutting interest rates, fueling concerns about a potential surge in inflation. During this timeframe, Bitcoin price action was mostly negatively correlated with the bonds, confirming the theory.\nGovernment bonds are also directly related to the notion of debt. When governments issue more debt (sell more bonds) to finance spending, the increased supply can lead to higher yields. If the debt reaches unsustainable levels, there is a risk of dollar debasement. The US adding $13 trillion to its debt since 2020 is unsettling news for the economy and, by extension, Bitcoin in the short term. In the longer run, however, this could increase interest in Bitcoin as an alternative currency.\nRay Dalio, CEO of Bridgewater Associates, recognized this possibility. Speaking at Abu Dhabi Finance Week, the billionaire expressed a preference for \u201chard money\u201d over debt-based investments,\nDalio pointed out that rising global debt will likely diminish the value of fiat currencies, predicting inevitable debt crises. So there could come a time when high bond yields signal an economy unable to sustain its own debt. This, in turn, might reverse the current correlation between Bitcoin and bonds.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The aggregate market value of cryptocurrencies in this sector is down 12% over the last 24 hours.\nMemecoin market capitalization and daily trading volume. Source: CoinMarketCap\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector nearly halved over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\nTRUMP and MELANIA tokens were heavily traded, with $25 billion and $2.4 billion in trading volumes, respectively, over the last 24-hour period. This indicates high selling intensity for these memecoins as profit-booking continued.\u00a0\nAdditional data shows that overall buying volumes for these tokens are stalling in line with prices on the Moonshot trading app, which was among the first to offer TRUMP to retail traders.\nFor example, TRUMP buying volumes on the app have dropped from an average above $6 million on Jan. 18 to Jan. 19 to below $1 million on Jan. 21, according to a Dune dashboard created by @Seoulcalibur.eth.\nTRUMP buying volumes through Moonshoot.

In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\u00a0\nDOGE saw its OI drop by over 12% on the day to $4.66 billion, nearly four times TRUMP\u2019s $1.07 billion in OI, which had decreased by 23% over the same period.

        "content": " Dogecoin slumps as Trump\u2019s crypto silence and mounting challenges at Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE initiative weigh on market sentiment. \nDogecoin (DOGE) price has dropped by around 12% in the last 24 hours to reach $0.338 on Jan. 21. \nThe memecoin\u2019s decline appears alongside a broader crypto market selloff, which, in turn, is plunging after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 45th president of the United States, hinting at a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\nDOGE/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\nLet\u2019s examine the factors driving DOGE prices lower today in detail.\nDogecoin\u2019s drop in the past 24 hours appeared as Trump\u2019s first set of executive orders made no reference to cryptocurrencies, thus disappointing an industry that for months has rallied behind the president to bring a wave of crypto-friendly policies in the US.\n\"The market has some great expectations about a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a loosening of regulations around digital assets,\u201d Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Astronaut Capital, told Reuters, adding: \nHowever, unlike the broader crypto market, DOGE already declined ahead of Trump\u2019s oath-taking ceremony. The memecoin formed its local top at $0.434 on Jan. 19 and has since decreased in price by over 22.50%.\nInterestingly, around the same time DOGE established its local top, Trump and his wife, Melania Trump,\u00a0launched\u00a0their \u201cofficial\u201cmemecoins, which briefly boomed following their debut across crypto exchanges.\nTRUMP/USD versus MELANIA/USD hourly price performance. Source: TradingView\nHowever, $TRUMP and $MELANIA memecoins dropped alongside DOGE in the past 24 hours, with -29% and -60% losses.\nDogecoin\u2019s decline in the past 24 hours further coincides with Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s departure from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a government initiative he originally planned to co-head with Elon Musk.\nRamaswamy announced he would step down to focus on a potential bid for Ohio Governor, leaving Musk as the sole leader of the agency.\nSource: X\nAdditionally, the Dogecoin price drop followed reports claiming that public interest law firm National Security Counselors will likely sue DOGE, citing the alleged violation of federal transparency laws.\nAlthough Dogecoin has no formal connection to the US government agency, the shared acronym and Musk\u2019s prominent role have tied the two in the minds of traders and the broader Dogecoin community. \nSpeculation and meme-driven enthusiasm helped Dogecoin rally in 2024 when the department was first announced. However, today\u2019s legal and political challenges appear to be weighing on market sentiment.\nDogecoin\u2019s price gains today are part of a consolidation trend occurring inside its prevailing symmetrical triangle pattern.\nThe symmetrical triangle reflects indecision in the market, with both buyers and sellers testing their limits. A breakout from this pattern could result in sharp price moves in either direction.\nDOGE/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView\nThe triangle\u2019s height\u2014measured from its widest point\u2014suggests a potential upside target of $0.59 if Dogecoin breaks above the upper trendline. In other words, DOGE/USD could grow by over 70% by February.\nRelated: Dogecoin to $1? Traders say a 140% DOGE rally could happen before February\nConversely, a downside breakout could push the price toward $0.20, representing a 42% decline from current levels.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": " A crypto-friendly US government could form the base for new highs for Bitcoin and other digital assets. \nThe United States is ready to usher in a new era with the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th president. The ceremony marks Trump\u2019s triumphant return to the White House after a four-year hiatus during former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, and it is already massively lifting spirits and prices across the cryptocurrency market.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s return aligned with Bitcoin (BTC) price soaring to new highs as anticipation builds for an industry-friendly approach to emerging technologies. Trump\u2019s appointments of crypto-friendly staff to his cabinet, including prominent Silicon Valley investor David Sacks as White House crypto czar also has investors feeling optimistic for the future of the industry.\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Eugene Epstein, the head of trading and structured products at Moneycorp, said,\u00a0\nPresident Trump\u2019s election victory ignited a massive rally, serving as a key catalyst for bullish activity and driving Bitcoin to surpass an all-time high of $109,000 on inauguration day.\nThe US is already the largest sovereign holder of Bitcoin, mostly due to judicial seizures. According to data from Bitbo, the country holds over 200,000 Bitcoin in custody \u2014 equivalent to nearly $22 billion.\nBut crypto markets are trading on the expectation that the US will unload massive purchases going forward, Epstein said. During the campaign, Trump floated the idea of building a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the country, akin to El Salvador\u2019s initiative in recent years.\u00a0\nSupporters, including MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Tether and other major institutional players, have praised this idea, advocating for the US and other countries to accumulate Bitcoin as a means to stave off inflation.\n\u201cMasses showed up and voted for more economic freedom in 2024 when they elected Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a Jan. 17 post.\u00a0\nWhile such a move would certainly bode well for Bitcoin, it remains unclear so far whether Trump will eventually pull the trigger.\nAccording to Epstein, a large-scale purchase of crypto by any level of the US government has already been priced in and could revert if expectations are not met. \u201cI have a hard time seeing markets moving higher unless some sort of state-level plan actually begins,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would expect this to be led by the Treasury.\u201d\nTrump has shown a renewed interest in cryptocurrencies during his 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting the sector as a priority for his second term. He has also hinted at the possibility of introducing US regulations to provide clarity for the industry.\n\u201cIf crypto is going to define the future, I want (it) to be mined, minted and made in the USA,\u201d he said last year. \u201cAmerica should build the future, not block it.\u201d\nThe crypto-friendly appointments across Trump\u2019s administration hint at a dramatic departure from the policies of the previous administration, during which the Securities and Exchange Commission pursued a sweeping crackdown on the industry. Although Trump has yet to detail the responsibilities of Sacks as crypto czar, the choice signals a likely bullish stance on both AI and cryptocurrency.\nRelated: US Bitcoin reserve has pundits in tailspin as Trump inauguration looms\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s return to the White House has already cheered up many in the crypto space.\n\u201cPresident Trump in the White House is really good for us,\u201d Stacy Herbert, who leads El Salvador\u2019s National Bitcoin Office, told Cointelegraph. The country is one of the few jurisdictions that already has its own regulations for the sector.\u00a0\nStill, experts warn that there is still much to be seen, urging for caution amid a buying frenzy in the space.\nOn Jan. 17, the then-US president-elect made waves in the crypto world by launching his own memecoin, TRUMP, which saw record demand in no time and created a market cap worth billions out of thin air.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: this is more gambling than investing,\u201d Nigel Green, CEO of UAE-based deVere Group, said in a press release. \nTrump\u2019s presidency is expected to usher in an era of pro-crypto policies, he said, and while this could pave the way for legitimate growth for established assets like Bitcoin, it also \u201craises questions about the risks of speculative trading driven by social media hype.\u201d\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": " The expanding ranks of pro-Bitcoin presidents are boosting global optimism for crypto mass adoption. \nThe \u201cTrump trade\u201d is back in full swing, with pro-crypto leaders like President Donald Trump, Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei, and El Salvador\u2019s Nayib Bukele signaling a new era in crypto regulation as the Trump inauguration ends and Trump takes the helm as the 47th president of the United States.\nThe trio, all in the early stages of their presidential terms across the Americas, have positioned themselves as perhaps crypto\u2019s biggest political champions, sparking hopes of unprecedented government support and possibly heralding a new, friendlier posture toward the industry that could have far-reaching implications at a global scale.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s signaling to the sector is likely to boost the industry globally,\u201d Guilherme Rebane, partner at digital asset trading firm Nonco, told Cointelegraph.\u00a0\nFrom establishing Bitcoin as a legal tender in El Salvador to Argentina accepting rental payments in crypto or the US creating a crypto czar position in the administration, the pro-crypto stance of the trio has already translated into action. As Donald Trump prepares to take office as the next US president, it\u2019s the perfect moment to examine how the actions of these three presidents are shaping the ecosystem.\nOn Jan. 20, Bitcoin soared to new highs ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration, trading as high as around $109,000 at some points of the day. In a break from tradition, the ceremony will feature other political leaders as official guests, including Argentina\u2019s Milei and Bukele. Although the president of El Salvador confirmed he received a formal invitation, he has not publicly stated whether he will attend the event.\nBoth Latin American leaders, who quickly congratulated Trump after his Nov. 4 win, could signal a shift in US-Latin American relations. Despite strong ties with Mexico and significant trade with South American powerhouse Brazil, the presidents of these left-wing administrations were notably absent from the official guest list for Trump\u2019s inauguration, suggesting a potential realignment under the new US administration.\nRelated: Bitcoin hits new all-time high above $109K ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration\nThe Trump era could mark a pivotal chapter in Bitcoin\u2019s history, though much remains to be seen. He has previously expressed his intention to make the United States the global capital of crypto and Bitcoin and has appointed David Sacks, a prominent Silicon Valley investor, as the \u201cWhite House AI and crypto czar.\u201d\u00a0\nPreviously, President Trump has taken credit for Bitcoin\u2019s historic run, citing his long-standing support and promotion of the cryptocurrency\u2019s use in the US market. Still, El Salvador is already feeling tangible benefits from the rise in its price.\n\u00a0\u201cI personally believe that this year\u2014and the years to come, but especially this one with Trump\u2019s inauguration\u2014will be very significant for Bitcoin and the entire ecosystem,\u201d Bukele declared during a press conference on Jan. 14. He predicted a \u201clikely exponential\u201d revaluation of Bitcoin and a \u201cfriendlier ecosystem\u201d ahead.\nBukele has been on a mission to rebrand his small, struggling nation as a hub for cryptocurrency and tourism. In 2021, he made headlines by pioneering Bitcoin as legal tender, a bold move that placed the country at the forefront of the crypto revolution. His administration has also strategically boosted El Salvador\u2019s Treasury reserves with regular Bitcoin purchases, which now total $650 million worth.\nRelated: Bitcoin reserves interest gains momentum across 5 continents\nWhile this posture initially faced rejection from traditional financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, Bukele\u2019s gambit has proven fruitful, with Bitcoin purchases generating significant profits for the treasury. Though a recent agreement with the IMF suggests the country may scale back certain extreme policies \u2014 such as making Bitcoin acceptance optional rather than mandatory \u2014 El Salvador remains a key player in the space, with companies like Tether relocating its office to the country after securing a license.\nJavier Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Donald Trump after the election, flying from Buenos Aires to the president-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club after the election. \nKnown for his \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d views, Milei has gained frequent praise from high-profile figures like billionaire Elon Musk, who will lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency with a mission to cut federal programs, slash regulations, and streamline government operations.\nMilei has been a vocal advocate for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology from the outset, seamlessly integrating these into his free-market philosophy. During his campaign trail, he promised to abolish the central bank in Argentina, and during his first year in office, he pushed for the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions.

        "content": " Bitcoin hit new highs on Jan. 20, but data shows traders are neutral as the market waits to see if a BTC-friendly executive order is issued by President Trump. \nBitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high of $109,321 on Jan. 20, driven by expectations of a more crypto-friendly administration under United States President Donald Trump. The optimism stemmed from campaign promises for regulatory clarity and the appointment of pro-crypto figures to key positions.\nDespite the price surge, sentiment among Bitcoin whales and market makers remained stable. According to derivatives data, there was little confidence in further gains above $110,000, at least in the short term.\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\nOn Jan. 20, the Bitcoin futures premium relative to spot markets rose to 14%, up from 12% on Jan. 17. Although this figure exceeds the 10% neutral threshold, it reflects moderate skepticism among professional traders. Historically, bullish rallies have pushed the BTC futures premium beyond 30%.\nTo assess whether this effect is confined to futures markets, analysts also examine the BTC options skew metric. This indicator compares premiums on similar call (buy) and put (sell) options. Ratios between -6% and +6% are considered neutral, while a negative skew suggests bullish sentiment.\nBitcoin 2-month options 25% delta skew (put-call). Source: Laevitas.ch\nCurrently, the Bitcoin options 25% delta skew at Deribit stands at -6%, indicating a cautious level of optimism. This suggests that BTC derivatives markets are not showing signs of overconfidence, though this does not imply bearish sentiment.\nAfter hitting a record high, Bitcoin's price fell below $105,000, leading traders to speculate whether Trump\u2019s inauguration represents a \u201csell the news\u201d scenario. Many expected measures to support the crypto market have already been announced, reducing the element of surprise. Furthermore, the potential for a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\" plan depends on congressional and Senate approval, making its implementation uncertain.\nPart of Bitcoin investors\u2019 lack of enthusiasm and the subsequent price correction can be attributed to uncertainty surrounding the spiraling US fiscal debt situation, which has prompted investors to tread more cautiously.\nThe US federal budget deficit for the first fiscal quarter of 2025 surged nearly 40% compared to the same period in the previous year, according to the Treasury Department. Additionally, market projections estimate government debt financing costs will exceed $1.2 trillion in 2025, surpassing last year\u2019s record.\nRelated: Bitcoin hits new all-time high above $109K ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration\nIn a Jan. 17 letter to congressional leaders, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the federal government would reach its borrowing limit on Jan. 21. She announced plans to employ \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to temporarily free up borrowing capacity under the $36.1 trillion debt ceiling, averting a potential default.\nFailure by lawmakers to reach a fiscal agreement in the coming days could trigger a partial government shutdown, disrupting essential services, delaying federal employee payments, and unsettling financial markets. This uncertainty has increased traders\u2019 incentives to secure profits, particularly after Bitcoin\u2019s price above $109,000 reflected a 17% year-to-date gain.\nWhile professional traders remain cautious about further Bitcoin price increases, there are no signs of a surge in bearish bets. Data indicates that most traders have either stayed on the sidelines or positioned themselves for more sideways price action. However, a continued Bitcoin price surge could catch whales and market makers off guard, especially in a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the US.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": " Bitcoin retracts sharply from its all-time high and the sell-off in Official Trump has a resounding negative impact on most altcoins. \nBitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high above $109,500 on Jan. 20, after the odds for a strategic Bitcoin reserve skyrocketed to 69% on DeFi betting market Polymarket. \nThe newly launched Trump family-related memecoins, Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania (MELANIA), have also seen massive interest from the cryptocurrency trading community. Intergovernmental blockchain expert and author Anndy Lian told Cointelegraph that the memecoin launches will usher in a \u201cnew era for memecoins and altcoins.\u201d\nDaily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360\nEuphoric times offer several trading opportunities, but they come with a risk. Vertical rallies are generally non-sustainable and are followed by sharp pullbacks. The deep pullback in TRUMP and Solana\u2019s (SOL) volatility suggests that traders should exercise caution.\u00a0\nCan Bitcoin recapture its all-time high and trigger buying in altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts to find out.\nThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) reversed strongly last week and broke above the moving averages, indicating that the break below 5,853 on Jan. 10 may have been a bear trap.\nSPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 20-day exponential moving average (5,934) has flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen into positive territory, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between 6,050 and 6,100.\u00a0\nIf the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index may form a range between 6,050 and 5,853. The next trending move is expected to begin on a break above 6,100 or below 5,773.\nThe US Dollar Index once again took support at the 20-day EMA (108.62) on Jan. 15, indicating that every minor dip is being purchased.\nDXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe RSI is showing signs of forming a negative divergence, suggesting that the bullish momentum is weakening. Sellers will have to yank the price below the 20-day EMA to open the doors for a deeper fall to 108 and then to the 50-day SMA (107.32).\nContrarily, a break and close above 110.17 will signal the continuation of the uptrend. The index could rally to 113.14 and eventually to 114.77. Buyers may find it challenging to clear the 114.77 hurdle.\nBitcoin rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($99,257) on Jan. 20 and skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $109,588.\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nIf buyers maintain the price above $108,353, it will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend. The bulls will then try to thrust the price toward $126,706.\nOn the contrary, if the price fails to sustain above $108,353, it will suggest that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Sellers will have to pull the price below the moving averages to weaken the bullish momentum. The BTC/USDT pair could then consolidate between $109,588 and $90,000 for a few days.\nDue to the enormous popularity and volatility of the TRUMP memecoin, Cointelegraph is providing short-term analysis. A 30-minute chart has been used since there is little price history to look to for deeper insights.\nTRUMP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe TRUMP/USDT pair has dipped below the symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling that the bulls are losing their grip. If the price maintains below the uptrend line, the pair could tumble to $38. This is a critical level to watch out for in the near term because a break below it may sink the pair to $24.\nOn the contrary, a strong bounce off the current level will suggest buying at lower levels. The bulls will then try to push the pair back into the triangle. Buyers will be back in command on a close above the downtrend line.\nEther (ETH) bulls are defending the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern but are facing selling near the 50-day SMA ($3,537).\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe downsloping 20-day EMA ($3,362) and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a slight edge to the bears. A break and close below $3,125 could accelerate selling, pulling the ETH/USDT pair toward $2,850.\u00a0\nBuyers will have to push and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA to indicate that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could then rally to $3,745, which is likely to behave as a stiff hurdle.\nXRP (XRP) bounced off the breakout level of $2.91 on Jan. 20, indicating that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support.\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe XRP/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum after buyers push and sustain the price above the $3.40 overhead resistance. That could start the next leg of the uptrend toward the pattern target of $4.84.\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA ($2.75). The pair may then sink to the 50-day SMA ($2.46). This is an important level to watch out for because a drop below the 50-day SMA could start a decline to $2.\nBNB (BNB) has been trading between the uptrend line and the overhead resistance at $745 for the past few days.\nBNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price rises above the moving averages, the BNB/USDT pair will again attempt to rally above $745. If that happens, the pair could surge to $794.\nContrarily, a break and close below the uptrend line will signal that the bulls are closing their positions. That could sink the pair to the $635 support, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.\nSolana has been hugely volatile for the past two days, indicating an intense battle between the bulls and the bears.\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($214) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that buyers are in command. A close above $260 improves the prospects of a retest of the all-time high at $295. If this level is scaled, the SOL/USDT pair may surge to $300 and eventually $375.\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $229, it will signal that the bulls are rushing to the exit. The pair may then drop to the 20-day EMA. A deep correction is likely to delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.\nRelated: Why is XRP price up today?\nDogecoin (DOGE) has been rising inside an ascending channel pattern for the past few days, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies.\nDOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 20-day EMA ($0.36) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, signaling a balance between supply and demand. If the price dips below the channel, the DOGE/USDT pair could slide to the $0.27 to $0.23 support zone. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone.\nThe bulls will be back in the driver\u2019s seat on a close above the channel. That could clear the path for a rally to $0.48. Sellers are expected to vigorously defend the $0.48 level because a break above it may propel the pair to $0.59.\nCardano (ADA) has been trading inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nIt is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty as the flattish moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\u00a0\nIf buyers drive the price above the triangle, the ADA/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $1.33. If this level is crossed, the rally could extend to $1.64. On the other hand, a break and close below the triangle could sink the pair to $0.80.\nChainlink (LINK) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($22.72) on Jan. 19, indicating that the sentiment remains positive, and traders are buying on dips.\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe LINK/USDT pair rose above the $26 overhead resistance on Jan. 20, indicating that the bulls remain in control. If the price sustains above $26, the pair could retest the overhead resistance at $31.\nInstead, if the price fails to maintain above $26, it will suggest selling on rallies. The bears will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to signal strength. That increases the risk of a fall to $20.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 20-day exponential moving average ($98,800) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive zone, signaling that the buyers have the edge. If bulls pierce the overhead resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend to $126,706.\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down from $108,353, it will signal that bears are active at higher levels. The pair may slide to the 20-day EMA, an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to clear the hurdle at $108,353.\u00a0\nSellers will have to pull the price below the moving averages to start a consolidation between $90,000 and $108,353 for a few days.\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe moving averages are sloping up on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating an advantage to buyers. There is a minor hurdle at $106,000, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then challenge the critical level of $108,353.\nTime is running out for the bears. If they want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-EMA. That opens the doors for a fall to $100,000 and subsequently to the 50-simple moving average.\nXRP (XRP) is correcting in an uptrend, indicating that the short-term buyers are booking profits.\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe XRP/USDT pair could slide to the breakout level of $2.91, a vital level to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the $2.91 level with force, it will signal that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That increases the possibility of a break above $3.40. The pair may then rally toward the pattern target of $4.84.\nContrarily, a break below $2.91 will signal that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may sink to the 20-day EMA ($2.71) and later to the 50-day SMA ($2.44).\nXRP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe bears pulled the price below the 20-EMA but are struggling to sink the pair to $2.91. This signals buying on dips. If the price rises and sustains above the 20-EMA, the pair could retest the $3.40 resistance. A break above this level could start the next leg of the upward move to $4.10.\nIf the price turns down from the 20-EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $2.91 increases. Sellers will have to drag and maintain the price below $2.91 to suggest the start of a deeper correction.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe buyers extended the rally on Jan. 19, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. The $260 level is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. If the price turns up from $260, the SOL/USDT pair could rise to $300 and later to $375.\nSellers will have to tug and maintain the price below $260 to weaken the bullish momentum. That may tempt buyers to book profits, pulling the pair to $240 and eventually to the 20-day EMA ($212).\u00a0\nSOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe 4-hour chart shows buyers booked profits near the $300 level. That pulled the price to the breakout level of $260. This is a critical level to watch out for because a solid bounce off it will suggest that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. The pair will again try to break above $300 and resume the uptrend.\nConversely, a weak bounce off $260 will suggest a lack of aggressive buying. That increases the risk of a breakdown to the 20-EMA. If this level also cracks, the pair may collapse to $220.\nOfficial Trump has witnessed a massive rally since its launch.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe TRUMP/USDT pair pulled back from $79 but is finding support at the 20-EMA. This suggests that the sentiment remains positive, and traders are buying the dips. The bulls will make another attempt to clear the barrier at $79. If they manage to do that, the pair could soar to $109.\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and closes below the 20-EMA, it will indicate that the traders are aggressively booking profits. The selling could pick up further if the pair drops below $53. That could extend the decline to the 50-SMA.\nRelated: Insider trading allegations surface as TRUMP memecoin floods Solana DEXs\nAlgorand (ALGO) turned down from $0.50 on Jan. 17, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the level.\nALGO/USDT daily chart.

If the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $0.16, the pair could start the next leg of the rally to $0.20.\nInstead, if the price turns down and breaks below $0.12, it will suggest that the bulls are rushing to the exit. The pair could then skid to the 20-day EMA ($0.11). Sellers will have to yank the price below the 20-day EMA to indicate that the pair may have topped out in the short term.\nXDC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\nThe pair slipped below the 20-EMA, but the bulls bought the dip. Buyers will try to push the price above the downtrend line. If they do that, the pair could reach $0.16. This level may offer stiff resistance, but the pair could resume its uptrend if the bulls prevail.\nThe 50-SMA is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below this level could sink the pair to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.10.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": " Official Trump memecoin launch breaks records, as Solana (SOL) rallies to new all-time high ",
        "content": " The Official Trump memecoin launch captivated the crypto market and could be behind Solana\u2019s new price highs, but the real question is, how sustainable is the rally? \nThe cryptocurrency market faced a surprise on Jan. 18 when the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin, endorsed by President-elect Donald Trump, was launched without prior notice. \nThe announcement came via Trump\u2019s social media accounts, directing users to purchase the Solana token using a specified centralized intermediary and providing the contract address.\nThe memecoin launch sparked a rally in Solana\u2019s (SOL) native token, pushing it to an all-time high of $270. This surge raised questions among traders about whether SOL\u2019s current $120 billion market capitalization is sustainable and its implications for Ethereum, Solana\u2019s main competitor. Ethereum had previously been perceived as Trump\u2019s favorite due to its allocation within World Liberty Financial, a project closely associated with Trump, but the decision to launch Official Trump on the Solana network has raised eyebrows.\nEther/USD (left) vs. SOL/USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph\nAdding to the intrigue was the timing of the launch, which coincided with the Trump-honoring \u201cCrypto Ball,\u201d a high-profile event that brought together industry leaders such as Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the Winklevoss twins of Gemini, and David Sacks, Trump\u2019s crypto and artificial intelligence adviser. The sold-out event took place just a few blocks from the White House in Washington, D.C.\nDespite the competitive memecoin market, the Official Trump (TRUMP) token quickly reached a $6.9 billion market capitalization. It was immediately listed on major exchanges, including Bybit, Bitget, and KuCoin. The memecoin launched with 200 million tokens in circulation and a total supply of up to 1 billion, with 80% allocated to the issuers.\nTRUMP token proposed allocation and distribution. Source: GetTrumpMemes\nIssuers reportedly deposited 44.4 million TRUMP tokens into single-sided liquidity pools, meaning no direct pairing with assets like stablecoins. The decentralized exchange Meteora (DEX) was chosen to manage the automated market-making (AMM) process alongside Jupiter DEX. The two largest liquidity pools were TRUMP-USDC, with a total value locked (TVL) of $483 million, and TRUMP-SOL, holding $67 million.\nCurrently trading at $24.60, the \u201cOfficial Trump\u201d (TRUMP) token is ranked as the 28th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with trading volumes exceeding $7 billion across decentralized and centralized exchanges. \nFor comparison, TRUMP\u2019s trading volume has surpassed Dogecoin (DOGE), the oldest memecoin and a sector leader with a $58 billion market cap. As a result, Solana\u2019s decentralized platforms, such as Meteora and Raydium, saw significant benefits from the TRUMP token launch.\nThe memecoin market overall experienced a negative impact as traders shifted their focus to the President-elect\u2019s token. More than 200,000 users purchased \u201cOfficial Trump\u201d (TRUMP) directly through its official app, Moonshot, which facilitated nearly $400 million in trading volume. In contrast, Dogecoin dropped 6%, Shiba Inu (SHIB) fell 7.5%, PEPE declined by 10.5%, and Dogwifhat (WIF) saw an 8% decrease.\nRelated: Crypto industry skeptical of memecoin promoted on Trump's social media\nFor Ether (ETH) holders, the event posed a double challenge. First, it strengthened Solana\u2019s position as the go-to ecosystem for token launches. Second, it diminished expectations that the Trump administration might favor Ethereum despite Trump\u2019s previous connections to the Ethereum-based World Liberty Finance project.\nWhether the \u201cOfficial Trump\u201d (TRUMP) token can maintain its price above $20 remains uncertain. Furthermore, for SOL price to break through $300, the Solana network must significantly expand its market share in terms of deposits and institutional adoption. This growth is also contingent on the approval of a Solana spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which remains a key catalyst for future gains.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": " XRP's current bearish divergence setup mirrors the technical pattern seen in 2018, which preceded an 80% price correction. \nJanuary\u2019s XRP (XRP) price rally risks hitting a point of exhaustion due to an emerging bearish reversal signal.\nXRP has surged nearly 50% in January, briefly topping $3.39 on Jan. 18, its highest level in nearly seven years. However, the explosive rally may face headwinds, with technical indicators signaling a potential downside correction of up to 25%.\nA key concern is the emergence of a bearish divergence between XRP\u2019s price and its daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). While XRP has been climbing to multi-year highs, the momentum oscillator RSI has trended lower, forming a descending pattern. \nThis divergence indicates that the upward momentum behind XRP\u2019s rally is weakening, raising the likelihood of a reversal in the coming days or weeks.\nXRP/USD daily price chart (Binance). Source: TradingView\nAdditionally, XRP\u2019s price remains significantly above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), a key technical support level. \nAs of Jan. 18, the 50-day EMA sits near $2.28, approximately 25% below XRP\u2019s current price of $3.07. Historically, overextended price rallies tend to revisit their EMA levels as traders lock in profits and the market stabilizes, as shown in the 80% correction following a bearish divergence signal in 2018 below.\nXRP/USD daily price chart featuring 2018\u2019s bearish divergence correction.\nMoreover, XRP\u2019s latest rally has brought its RSI reading to 66.87, approaching the overbought threshold of 70. \nWhile not yet overbought, the RSI\u2019s declining trend suggests waning buying pressure at current levels, which could amplify selling pressure toward the $2.28 downside target.\nAs noted above, XRP\u2019s bearish divergence raises the likelihood of a pullback toward $2.28, which aligns with the upper trendline of its prevailing bull flag pattern.\nA bull flag pattern forms when the price consolidates inside a downward-sloping parallel channel after a strong uptrend. It typically resolves when the price breaks above the upper trendline and rises by as much as the previous uptrend\u2019s height.\nXRP/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\nXRP has already entered the breakout stage of its bull flag pattern. However, after a breakout, the price often retests the pattern\u2019s upper trendline to confirm it as new support. \nSuch a retest validates the breakout and provides an entry point for new buyers. A successful bounce from the upper trendline strengthens the bullish case and sets the stage for a move higher toward the original upside target.\nIn XRP\u2019s case, the bull flag\u2019s upside target is around $4.42, up 40% from current price levels. Additionally, XRP\u2019s long-term outlook remains optimistic, supported by the potential launch of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US. \nRelated: XRP price to $10\u2013$50 'plausible' if spot ETF approved, ChatGPT says\nJP Morgan analysts predict that these funds may attract $4 billion-to-$8 billion in assets under management.\nIf the XRP price fails to hold above the flag\u2019s upper trendline, it risks invalidating the bullish setup entirely. In such a scenario, the next downside target could be the pattern\u2019s lower trendline near $1.90, a level that prevented XRP's downside in December. \nXRP/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\nA break below $1.90 would shift the trend decisively bearish, opening the door to deeper declines, potentially toward the 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $1.35.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
